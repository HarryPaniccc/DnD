The **North Estravian Faults** are a vast region north of the province of [[Estravia]] in [[Sirkonos]] akin to a titanic-scale bed of a dried lake, where plateaus of varied elevations are separated by deep chasms hiding ancient horrors.

| (7,11)   | A clear entrance to the height of the planes from above                                                                                                                                    |
| (8,10)   | A deep valley in the chasms, a rare opening where one can ascend out of the chasms should they wish                                                                                        |
| (10,11)  | Tall, spire-like plates accentuate this region. Notably, some bridges are constructed here, making pathing through this plane a 2-hour route if one manages to follow a path successfully. |



Hexes adjacent to the (11, 9) mountain are less shattered and do not require a DC 15 Survival check to cross in 3 hours.
