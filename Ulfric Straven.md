# Description
**Ulfric Straven** is a veteran captain of the [[Ashen Legion]] and commander of a few local guard units after retiring from [[Holdren the Unfelled|Holdren's]] army. As he has entered his later years, however, he has passed his responsibilities on to the next men in line for his command of city watch in a neighborhood of [[Dularen]], and offered his services to various local nobles, aristocrats, and merchants.

Looking for a more permanent position while also desiring to leave the city, Ulfric was eager to respond to the [[Vanguard|Vanguard's]] call for a house steward who also had military experience.

>**Liam's Description**
>*A veteran of siege warfare who served alongside lord holdren in the past, middle class born to a family of wealthy farm owners who joined the ashen legion to pursue a different career path, the soldier has been serving for near 15 years and despite the short career, has been incredibly successful, however they wish to retire from active field duty as a commander to less extreme life. While coming back and working for his family is an option, the military life is still something they wish to pursue and so he has been looking for a more peaceful job but one that will still allow him to keep his tactical mind exercised. He is familiar with organising troops and how to feed and keep a force of people in shape as well as having some farming knowledge and accounting skills learned from his family, the siege expertise will allow him to properly organise a defensible keep. His reason for change is that he's recently both lost an arm to the elbow and fathered twins, he wants to have a less front line position but still be able to do what he enjoys which is tactics, defense and siege*
