**Previous Session:** [[Session 89 - Marthirion, Marred by Seeing]]
**Subsequent Session:**
## Post Mortem

## Introduction
> "This is the legend of the Vanguard" or some kind of blurb. MAYBE do sequential lyrics to the sun the moon the stars or something.
> 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past decades, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Last session these things happened
- This is important because
- And then this

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are the first person to step foot along the path you tread in a long, long time.
> 
> The day is the 3rd of *Dul'ussahn*, 813, and you feel almost abuzz with magic, covered head to toe in wards and protections.

# Session TODO
Rylai pushes into the sealed [[Temple of Elemental Evil]], hoping to acquire access to the [[Ley Nexus]] present there that will allow her to access her magic more directly and purge her sorcerous powers.

Recall that the guardian outside warned of a great evil contained within the temple, something that he could allow no one to pass who would let it escape. Something eternal.

- Flashback for Rylai's Past
- Combat encounter x 2?
- Sneaking around maybe?
- Talk with Ophelia about what she wants/knows
- [[Sylphmade Cloak]]
- Note about her size making her harder to spot

### Encounters/Monsters Ideas
> Want to use aberrations, fiends and elementals
- Gibbering Mouther (FM! Seems more fun), or modify it to Daze
- Earth elemental of some kind, maybe a Xorn or with the earth elemental companion abilities
- **ABOLETH**
