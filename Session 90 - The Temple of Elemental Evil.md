# Planning
Rylai goes in to the temple and its derelict. The power present in the region that has been tainted by corruption brings life to elementals of evil inclinations. Rylai will need to make her way through a ruined temple and eventually make her way to the planar crossing at the centre of the temple.

Along the way she will speak with Ophelia about the region and its history as well as what Ophelia really sees within her. Ophelia sense Rylai's elemental inclination and is annoyingly pushing her to reclaim that connection.

She will meet a few fodder elemental creatures that will be fighting one another. As she enters deeper into the temple the power of the [[Ley Nexus]] will begin to react to her inherent power, and ice spirits will form.

## Introduction
> "This is the legend of the Vanguard" or some kind of blurb. MAYBE do sequential lyrics to the sun the moon the stars or something.
> 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past decades, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Last session these things happened
- This is important because
- And then this

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are the first person to step foot along the path you tread in a long, long time.
> 
> The day is the 3rd of *Dul'ussahn*, 813, and you feel almost abuzz with magic, covered head to toe in wards and protections.

# Session TODO
Rylai pushes into the sealed [[Temple of Elemental Evil]], hoping to acquire access to the [[Ley Nexus]] present there that will allow her to access her magic more directly and purge her sorcerous powers.

Recall that the guardian outside warned of a great evil contained within the temple, something that he could allow no one to pass who would let it escape. Something eternal.

- Flashback for Rylai's Past
- Combat encounter x 2?
- Sneaking around maybe?
- Talk with Ophelia about what she wants/knows
- [[Sylphmade Cloak]]
- Note about her size making her harder to spot

### Encounters/Monsters Ideas
> Want to use aberrations, fiends and elementals
- Gibbering Mouther (FM! Seems more fun), or modify it to Daze
- Earth elemental of some kind, maybe a Xorn or with the earth elemental companion abilities
- **ABOLETH**

# Flashback

# [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]]
---
Ophelia understands the history of the temple of elements before [[Tharizdun]] fell to the influence of the [[Seed of the Abyss]].

>[!Note] Why did she come with?
>Ophelia can understand the wound that Rylai has inflicted on herself, and she does not want her to continue to suffer. She believes that the only way for her to interact with her connection to the elemental planes is to understand her pain. You can't cut out a tumour if you dont understand it.
>
>Ophelia truly wants Rylai to embrace her connection to the elemental plane of air.

# Antechamber
---
> I can feel the movements of the stones beneath you, tiny one. My siblings are blind, and the wind conceals your movement, but the stones do not lie. You are new here, and of the new world.

A particularly evil earth elemental notices Rylai's presence with his tremorsense, but he will not alert the rest of the temple, as he believes that if he kills her he can use the power of her blood to escape his confinement. Rylai holds the power to open a sealed rift to the elemental planes, and can also step through the veil of the temple's imprisonment.

##### **ENCOUNTER:** 3 x Gargoyles and
