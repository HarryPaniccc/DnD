# Prejudice | Dagger of Acid
*Weapon (dagger), rare*
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, green acid to coat the blade. The acid remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d10 acid damage and have their armor class be reduced by 2 for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

> A heartbeat can be a death sentence, if it is being used to spread poison. One's own sign of life, killing them.
