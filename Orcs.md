**Orcs** are a race of beings in [[Helodaria]]. The first orcs were born some time before [[The Fall]], but legends say that the first Orcs were born when the blood of [[Gruumsh]] fell on [[Elves]] after being wounded by [[Corellon]] during [[The Fall]], but this legend is contradictory to the age of the race. These orc-like beings were orcs in their own way, but created unintentionally.
