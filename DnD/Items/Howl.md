### Howl
---
*Weapon (shortbow), rare*
Attack and damage rolls made with Howl gain a +1, and arrows fired from the weapon deal thunder damage instead of piercing damage. When an arrow is fired from it a gentle wolf’s howl can be heard as it soars through the air.

> The upkeep of the leather handle is degraded but the bow itself is of beautiful construction. There is a bone carving above the handle of a wolf’s head.
