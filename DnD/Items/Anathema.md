Anathema was the blade of [[Siegfried Einzbern]]. Once an adamantine weapon of exceptional quality, with history of forging in a great forge of [[Steinwalde]]. The weapon was once known as "Protector", but upon Siegfried's betrayal of the [[Kenifria|Kenifrian]] knights, the weapon began to erode away, and would be granted the name "Anathema". 
### Anathema
---
*Weapon (Longsword), very rare (requires attunement)*
Anathema is a cold iron and adamantine longsword, with wolf heads on the ends of the crossguard and pommel. Along the inside of the fuller of the blade, written in Dwarven Script, are the Celestial words "*finis coronat opus*".

You gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and damage from attacks made with this weapon ignore resistances and immunities. In addition, when *Anathema* hits a structure or an object, the attack is automatically a critical hit. When you roll damage with this weapon, you roll the damage die twice and choose the higher of the two rolls.

**Finis Coronat Opus**: As an action, you may point the blade of *Anathema* towards a creature that you can see and that is not obscured in any way, and speak its command phrase: "*Finis Coronat Opus*". That creature becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until seven days later. You may only have one sworn enemy at a time. When you make a melee weapon attack roll with *Anathema* against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll, and you deal an additional 1d12 slashing damage on hits against it. 

While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attacks with all other weapons, as the spirits of the Kenifrian Knights compel you to wield *Anathema*. When the creature stops being your sworn enemy, you may choose another after the next dawn.
