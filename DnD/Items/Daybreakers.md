The Daybreakers are a pair of heavy, light brass and gold gauntlets with a beautiful mithral inlay and arcane runes etched along where they end on the forearms and near the wrists.

The Mythical gauntlets of Lathander grow in power with the experience and triumph of their wielder. They have three tiers, each with different and more powerful properties. They might go up in tiers as the Lord of Radiance views appropriate, or if their wearer accomplishes a great deed or goal.

Crafted of brass and mithral, these heavy ornate gauntlets are a symbol of power for those who know their history, the runes marking their edges shimmering with energy. While wearing and attuned to the Daybreakers, the wearer gains the following benefits.

The Daybreakers grow in strength in accordance to the rules of the Vestiges of Divergence
## Dormant

- You have darkvision out to 30ft. If you already have darkvision, it is extended by 30ft.
- You have resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.
- At the start of your turn, you can choose to have the gauntlets begin to burn with radiant energy, covering your forearms, giving you the form of a Radiant Avatar. For 10 minutes, all of your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage and you shed bright light for 10ft and dim light for another 10ft.
## Awakened
- The extra damage done while in your avatar form is increased to 2d6. The energy now covers your entire arms.
- Your melee weapon attacks have a reach of 20ft when normally they would not reach that far. Damage done by attacks beyond their normal range is converted into only radiant damage.
- While in your avatar form, you are under the effects of the feather fall spell, seemingly as the radiant energy is keeping you aloft to a degree.
## Exalted
- The reach gained by your Radiant Avatar form is increased to 30ft.
- The extra damage done while you are in your avatar form is increased to 3d6. The radiant energy now covers your entire body.
