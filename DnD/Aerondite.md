#TODO 
When Aerondite is freed from the curse of the feywild, she more accurately resembles a [[Planetar]] in stats
# Statblock (Maddened)
She has 194 HP
```statblock
creature: Deva
name: Aerondite, Saint of the Dawn
ac: 20 (Plate + Shield)
hp: 192
actions:
  - name: Charge (recharge 6)
    desc: Aerondite moves up to her flying speed in a straight line, making a melee weapon attack on the first creature in her path. On a hit, the target is grappled by Aerondite. She continues to fly onwards, and when she reaches a wall, she slams the creature grappled by her into the wall. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 10 ft. moved this way and be stunned until the beginning of Aerondite's next turn. On a successful save, take only half the damage.
