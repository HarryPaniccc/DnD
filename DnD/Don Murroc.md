An ancient tower at the centre of Diredahl, Don Murroc has a history shrouded in warfare, in unity and in salvation. It is said that during the great walls of [[The Fall]], [[King Sirkon]] the first, before he had his crown, held the invaders of the great city of Diredahl from all sides by setting legendary archers on the battlements of Don Murroc, and having his people shelter inside. Though the city was taken, the spire was not, and with only twenty archers under his command, King Sirkon fended off the hoards that were beset on the city, and Sirkonos found its name, and its first king. 

The spire stands at a magnificent height, rising above the apex of structures of the walled city, within a fortress structure that sits like an iron rose at the centre of Diredahl. The top is a grand viewing platform, from which one can see all around for miles. With good enough eyes you could see [[Keldmire]] on a clear day. Around the structure are battlements, balconies, and stairways that all interlink into an intensely complex structure.Â
