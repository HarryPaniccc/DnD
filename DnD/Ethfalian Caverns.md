The Ethfalian Caverns are a large, mineral rich network of caves and tunnels that have formed around a region where the space between the [[Feywild]] and material plane is thin. The crystals found in these caverns are greatly varied in their properties, and often form large reflective or even luminescent clusters. Many stretches of the caverns even have massive, entirely crystal pillars that resemble support beams that span 20 - 50 feet in length.

The realm between the feywild is thin in these caverns, growing thinner and thinner as one heads deeper. The [[Steinefni Mining Company]] of [[Steinwalde]] has set up a walled section for the extraction of resources within the caverns, with a bridge that leads beyond a chasm that is never lowered, as beyond the chasm is deemed unsafe for excavation due to the weak barriers between the planes.
