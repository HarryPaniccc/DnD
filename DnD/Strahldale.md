Outside the northmost border of the [[Kingdom of Sirkonos]], squeezed between an ancient northern forest, the eastern wastes, and the Maghlas mountains, sitting comfortably on a gentle section of the foothills, is the quiet farming village of Strahldale. One of the calmest places in Sirkonos, Strahldaleâ€™s grazing fields rarely see a year without bountiful grazing. As such, and due to crop fields being too difficult to maintain on the slopes, Strahldale has become a very potent agricultural powerhouse. Although the chill in the winters descending from the mountains means that large barns need to be constructed to keep the animals warm and safe, Strahldale sees many furs, skins, meats and other animal products being exported throughout the harvest seasons.

The mineral water from the Efthalian Cave flows down the Sieleran River through the foothills north of the village, and collects in the White Lake south of the village. To the east, one can see the wastes, and to the west, a large, dark stretch of wilderness known as the Miletohr Wilds.
