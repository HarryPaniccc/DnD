### The Daybreakers (Exalted)
---
*Wonderous Item (Gauntlets), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*
Crafted of brass and mithral, these heavy ornate gauntlets are a symbol of power for those who know their history, the runes marking their edges shimmering with energy. While wearing and attuned to the Daybreakers, the wearer gains the following benefits:

You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage, and you have darkvision out to 30ft. If you already had darkvision, it is extended by 30ft.

At the start of your turn, you can choose to have the gauntlets begin to burn with radiant energy, covering your entire body in solar flame, giving you the form of a Radiant Avatar. For 10 minutes, you gain the following benefits.

- When you activate your form, blazing wings sprout from your back. You gain a flying speed of 60ft.
- You are immune to necrotic damage.
- All of your weapon attacks deal an extra 3d6 radiant damage.
- Your melee weapon attacks have a reach of 30ft when normally they would not reach that far. Attacks that hit beyond their normal range do only radiant damage.
- You shed bright light for 10ft and dim light for another 10ft.

Once you use your Radiant Avatar form, this property cannot be used again until you finish a long rest.
