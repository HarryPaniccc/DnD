# Staff of Damnation

*Quarterstaff, Very Rare, Requires Attunement*
The Staff of Damnation is a staff of reflective black metal, with red and gold handles along it. The top of the staff has a crooked, partial crescent, almost scythe-like in shape, and a deep orange jewel embedded in the top.

Damnation has a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. While holding the staff, your Charisma score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score, and your spell attack rolls and spell save DC increase by 1. When you hit a creature with Damnation, you deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage to that creature.

***Spells***. While holding this staff, you can cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: *Searing Lash* (Unlimited uses), *Shadow of Moil* (Once per day)
