**GENERAL NOTES**
- Banahras 1st around 09:00 am
- The vanguard is in Lathran's study in [[Kenifria]]
- Etc

The vanguard finds themselves in the study overlooking the cathedral in Kenifria. Inside the cathedral there are sounds of Basilisks below devouring a stone goblin. 
- Two basilisks devour the petrified goblin
- A basilisk near the left doorway lies dead, arrows extruding from its corpse

**ENCOUNTER**: Basilisks x 6, Hobgoblin Warlord, Goblins x 7

A goblin scouting party searches the region for whoever caused the commotion in the large central cavern in the Ethfalian caves, reasoning they must make strong slaves if they could defeat so many spiders and a corpse flower. They are lead by a hobgoblin captain.

- The hobgoblin captain has on him a *potion of invulnerability* and a *potion of superior healing*. He will use either if he needs to to survive.
