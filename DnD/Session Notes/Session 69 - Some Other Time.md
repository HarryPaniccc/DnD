**GENERAL NOTES**
- It is 12:30pm on Fvel'dranus 28th
- The vanguard is in the **ransacked armory** in [[Kenifria]]
- They have spent 4 hours adventuring through the [[Ethfalian Caverns]] and Kenifria

**SKYE is finishing the conjuring of a teleportation circle to the [[Hall of Verdicts]] in Dularen**

> It is widely regarded as taboo to draw power from blood magic. As you trace your sigils on the ground, absolute quiet in you're head, Skye, despite the violent ending of the battle surrounding you, you feel this murky warmth fading into your touch, as your sigilcraft becomes melded with the blood of your fallen ally.
> 
> The blood and death energy mixing with that of the arcane power you are conjuring forth to complete the teleportation ritual, the gem chalk partially turned to a paste with the murky, almost greenish goblin blood, you feel avenues of conjuration magic that have never been open to you before because of this axis of concentration you find yourself in.

If Skye decides to focus in on this darkness #TODO 

### [[Dularen]]
The vanguard are looking to teleport into the Hall of Verdicts. Ruina should be around 2 to 3 hours ahead of the [[Kingdom of Sirkonos]]. 

- The teleportation room in the Hall of Verdicts will have a young gentleman greet the [[Vanguard]] and immediately panic at seeing the body of [[Silb Heft|Silb]]
- At this time of day the halls are relatively full of lawmakers and judiciaries and the like

### The [[Dularen Heart-Kiln]]
The Heart-Kiln is a low, fortress-like stone structure. The masonry is of exceptional quality, thick stone walls embossed with symbols and imagery of dwarven lords and patrons. Statues of prominent figures are set around the temple grounds. 

- The vanguard push through a small congregation of people outside of the Kiln, going about daily service rites and such. Inside, [[Brindor Shieldwall]] will be hammering away at a buckler shield in the ritual forge chamber.
- The forge at the center will be where Brindor will attempt the resurrection ritual on Silb.
- 
### The [[Grave Nest]]
The Grave Nest is a wide open space, a graveyard and worshipping grounds for followers of the [[The Raven Queen]]. There are 5 temples within it, and the grounds are monitored by priests and clerics of the Raven Queen.

- Lorgar Thell will perform the resurrection ritual in a ritual chamber in one of the temples.
- Lorgar is 10th level

### The Ritual
#### Resurrection Rules
If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to three members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.

After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soulâ€™s connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.
#### Based on the players' contribution checks, you're going to need to wing it

##### Session 69 - Some Other Time Summary
**Fvel'dranus 28th**
- 12:00 Silb is lying dead on the floor of [[Kenifria]]'s weapons store room. Skye completes a ritual of Teleportation Circle. When the blood mixes with the spell craft, Skye sees visions of inspiration.
>12:10 The Vanguard arrive in the Heart Kiln of Dularen and Brindor Shieldwall conducts the ritual of Raise Dead, with Kanan assisting via channeling Athelstan's power, Skye assisting by shifting the chains of fate, and Rylei assisting by channeling bardic arcane energies.
- 13:10 Silb returns to life and is taken to rest in the Heart Kiln. [[Olaf Rein]] joins the Vanguard in his stead.
  Isilme tells the Vanguard of a bar that she knows in Dularen called the [[Red Dagger]]
- 13:30 The vanguard arrive and speak with [[Sabien]], prying into Isilme's past.
- 14:30 Isilme goes to castle Anavar, investigating the ruins and finding that a part of it is still being lived in as dignitary's quarters. She is followed by Skye's owl familiar.
>14:30 - 16:30 Rylei and Kanan investigate castle Anavar and find a secret section to the dungeon beneath the castle. Kanan uses his grim psychometry to see a vision of [[Ulrandir Vanariel]] standing before the painting in which [[Smudge]] was held captive, holding a dagger that was just used to murder the woman over whom he is standing
- 17:00 Skye and Rylei meet at the Imperial Annals and research house Vanariel. They follow up with an Earth Genasi Arbiter of the Sentinels who tells them of a General Isaac of the Boreal Conclave who was at the forefront of pushing Gundrei to arrest Ulrandir.
- 17:30 The party recollects themselves in a private room in the Red Dagger.
>Kanan pulls Isilme aside and he notes that they are not all so dissimilar. He confides in her about his past, and she confides in him about hers.
- Kanan and Isilme spar. The group goes to an inn for the evening, paid for by Olaf Rein, and turn in for the night once the sun has set.
**Banahras 1st**
- 08:00 - 09:00 The group prepares to return to Kenifria, Isilme attunes to the helmet of teleportation, and they teleport into Lathran's study in Kenifria.
