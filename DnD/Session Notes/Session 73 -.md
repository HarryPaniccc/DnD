**GENERAL NOTES**
- Time is 11:00 on Banahras 2nd. The party are at the [[Itchy Foot Inn]], Skye is doing homework and Caede and Arthur are on their way west of the city to meet with the battalion of reinforcements
- The weather is sunny and will hold for a few days

# The Encampment of the Silver Arrow
The battalion under [[Syr Emelia Richstrahd]] is the [[Battalion of the Silver Arrow]], consisting of rangers and soldiers who are sent around the region surrounding [[Mount Ethris]] as one of the most active Kronesguard forces.

- During the ride, Arthur will ask Caede

> Your path takes you off a road and through a small thicket of trees, growing darker and more forest-like with each passing minute, though there is a trail that Arthur points out to you. After riding for another few minutes, the thick trees overhead creating a protective layer from the sun above, you come around a corner where the path is surrounded by spiked barricades. A pair of soldiers, armoured in dark leather and breastplates, wielding crossbows, note your approach, and train their weapons on you. Behind them there is a fortified encampment of tents and fires and soldiers going about their business, on patrol, cooking rations and tending to their horses and their gear, banners of the Crown flying overhead

- The armoured Kronesguard that note the approach will need to be reasoned with to gain entrance to the camp: *Christoph* and *Oliver* are their names, and both are rangers
- Caede and the prince will receive strange stares

- [[Syr Emelia Richstrahd]] can be found sparring with her subordinates. They will be unarmoured and she will be 1v2ing two larger men. Her agility in combat is her advantage, she is actually quite short, but clearly very strong, and outmanoeuvres her opponents. She knocks one down and is then in a short moment of opening is forced into submission with a blade to her neck
- The Silver Arrow Battalion can be mobilized in two hours. They will be able to the Vanguard where they are needed
- There are banners of both the royal insignia of Sirkonos, and an arrow facing downwards, splitting a shield.
# Vorciln Manor
Lucius' forces have had his manor move to north of [[Strahldale]]
