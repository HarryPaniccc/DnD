**GENERAL NOTES**
- Banahras 1st around 14:00
- Just defeated [[Siegfried Einzbern]]
- In the cathedral of [[Kenifria]]

A thin, arcing rift to the feywild sits in the middle of the chamber, visible only when close to it. Siegfried's corpse, as well as his rusted blade, [[Anathema]], is all that remains. 
- A DC 20 Perception check reveals the Einzbern brand lying in the ash near where Siegfried sat with his fire. The brand can be **Grim Psychometryd**. A DC 15 history check from Kanan will reveal the vision of Siegfried taking the brand first, and Athelstan arriving to disrupt the sealing ritual
- The rift does not act as a portal to the [[Feywild]], but rather as a crack in the space between the planes, and the location through which the Einzbern's energies are being funnelled to keep [[Athelstan]] imprisoned.
- **When standing within 10ft of the rift, it can be observed that tendrils of light gently trail towards the hands of Kanan and the other remaining Einzberns. There are three tendrils, one directly to Kanan, another trailing off south, and a final one trailing east**

## Arthur and Erin
Arthur and Erin have been near [[Diredahl]] since Fvel'dranus 26th, recruiting a small army of [[Kronesguard]] rangers and infantry to assist with the upcoming battle.
- Should he call upon them, Arthur has managed to convince a [[Syr Emelia Richstrahd]], a general of a small contingent of rangers and infantry, that her disobeying the command of the King to not inspect the Castle of the Vorciln, especially if news of the culling has begun
- When they need them, the Vanguard will have at their behest a regiment of 243 men, including cavalry and archers. Any motions of the regiment will be chocked up to a mixup of orders for training routines.
