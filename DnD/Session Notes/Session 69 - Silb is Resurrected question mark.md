**GENERAL NOTES**
- It is 12:30pm on Fvel'dranus 28th
- The vanguard is in the **ransacked armory** in [[Kenifria]]
- They have spent 4 hours adventuring through the [[Ethfalian Caverns]] and Kenifria

**SKYE is finishing the conjuring of a teleportation circle to the [[Hall of Verdicts]] in Dularen**

> It is widely regarded as taboo to draw power from blood magic. As you trace your sigils on the ground, absolute quiet in you're head, Skye, despite the violent ending of the battle surrounding you, you feel this murky warmth fading into your touch, as your sigilcraft becomes melded with the blood of your fallen ally.
> 
> The blood and death energy mixing with that of the arcane power you are conjuring forth to complete the teleportation ritual, the gem chalk partially turned to a paste with the murky, almost greenish goblin blood, you feel avenues of conjuration magic that have never been open to you before because of this axis of concentration you find yourself in.

If Skye decides to focus in on this darkness #TODO 

### [[Dularen]]
The vanguard are looking to teleport into the Hall of Verdicts. Ruina should be around 2 to 3 hours ahead of the [[Kingdom of Sirkonos]]. 

- The teleportation room in the Hall of Verdicts will have a young gentleman greet the [[Vanguard]] and immediately panic at seeing the body of [[Silb Heft|Silb]]
- At this time of day the halls are relatively full of lawmakers and judiciaries and the like

### The [[Dularen Heart-Kiln]]
The Heart-Kiln is a low, fortress-like stone structure. The masonry is of exceptional quality, thick stone walls embossed with symbols and imagery of dwarven lords and patrons. Statues of prominent figures are set around the temple grounds. 

- The vanguard push through a small congregation of people outside of the Kiln, going about daily service rites and such. Inside, [[Brindor Shieldwall]] will be hammering away at a buckler shield in the ritual forge chamber.
- The forge at the center will be where Brindor will attempt the resurrection ritual on Silb.
- 
### The [[Grave Nest]]
The Grave Nest is a wide open space, a graveyard and worshipping grounds for followers of the [[The Raven Queen]]. There are 5 temples within it, and the grounds are monitored by priests and clerics of the Raven Queen.

- Lorgar Thell will perform the resurrection ritual in a ritual chamber in one of the temples.
- Lorgar is 10th level

### The Ritual
#### Resurrection Rules
If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to three members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.

After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soulâ€™s connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.
#### Based on the players' contribution checks, you're going to need to wing it
