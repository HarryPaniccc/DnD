GENERAL NOTES

- The signet ring born by [[Silb Heft]] is cursed. The DC for all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls made by a creature wearing the ring is increased by 1. Trying to cast the ring away fails, the ring magically reappearing in their most easy to access pocket. A Remove Curse Spell will cause the warping of the forge to be undone, and the ring is returned to its uncursed form (Worth 15gp).
    
- The time is midday on Fveldranus 27th.
    
- Silb has cast detect evil and good and will have it up for 10 minutes
    
- For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
    

  
THE ETHFALIAN DEPTHS

[[Jarren Ward]] leads the party towards a cluster of crystals where a small goblin war camp was made and dilapidated. 

Three crystals ascend from the ground into a cave-like convergence under which wooden platforms and tents have been made up.

Across the way from a shallow pool of water gently lit by glowing blue rock formations you see there is a cluster of three distinct large crystals that rise up to form a sort of structure resembling a tent. Around the cluster you can see what appears to be wooden structure and supports for something resembling a hut or platform of some sort, below which there are a cluster of 3 tents and a decrepit campfire.

There are 3 entrances to the cluster, one is boarded up by bad quality woodwork. One faces a natural bridge of sorts made of rock that crosses the water, and the third one is out of vision.

- The area is filled with a terrible rotting smell. Anyone who gets near to the opposite end of the camp is affected by the stench of death of the corpse flower that is in the ceiling, and it then attacks. 
    
- There are boxes and crates of supplies that have been long soiled - even a barrel of salted pork.
    
- There is a corpse flower hanging from the ceiling. A DC 12 perception check reveals the flower on the ceiling. Corpses of 5 knights are entangled and visible to those below.
    

The space under the crystal cluster appears to be a partially well lived-in campsite with a clearly dug fire pit at the centre that has not been used in some time. There are a set of 2 large tents that could comfortably fit 3 medium humanoids. The insides of the tents appear to have been dragged out entirely haphazardly as though at random. This incredible rotting stench lingers in the area.

-- ENCOUNTER - Corpse flower, zombies x 5 + created

If the zombies go first

There is a shifting in the vines that hang from the ceiling and in an instant there is this cacophony of gasping as these corpses hanging from above suddenly come to life and lurch free of their vines restraints, falling down onto you.

If the Corpse flower goes first

There is a shifting in the overhead dirt and vines as the flowered cluster of plants lurches free and with a startling haste rips free several of its roots and almost like a massive octopus crawls along the wall and lurches towards you.

- 5 zombies wearing decrepit chainmail: AC 17 and when they succeed on their undead fortitude check they can make one attack as a reaction.
    
- 1 corpse flower: HP 195 and has 1d6 + 1 extra bodies in it.
    

Loot:

- The bodies of the knights each have 2d6 silver and 3d4 copper on them.
    
- It is easy to notice there is a map laid out across a table next to the fireplace.
    

THE PATH THROUGH THE DEPTHS

There are many directions the party can follow the map

- The viewing well is an ancient site of divination. The connection to the astral plane in the area is thin.
    

The space is a sheltered cove inside of a quiet and peaceful cavern. At the apex of the cavern the stone grows more smoothe around a raised well of water with a gentle luminescence, casting reflective projections on the area around the cavern.

Magic

There is an ethereal air to the place. The water reflects one's form very well. An identify spell cast on the well has one have a vision of the weave. The light of the cavern dims and only the reflections and the water of the well casts anything into the space. It feels as though the well is almost sentient.

- A DC 15 perception check reveals in elven an inscription along the base of the well:
    

“Threads of the old lines weave forth to understanding. Cast into the water, and it might be yours”

If a player with Elven blood (Isilme) casts a strand of their hair into the pool, it will shimmer and react. There will be an intense glow as the brightness of the pool glows a stronger white and blue. The cavern is lit in a blinding display for a moment and the players cover their eyes instinctually. Then, a ray of moonlight shines from the pool to the roof of the cavern, and in it, a floating, ethereal elf form. The cadaverous edge will go cold at her appearance, but she will not be hostile.

“Blood of the old lines, what answers do you seek my children?”

She acts as a Commune spell for the party.

Treasure

- When the elf ghost disappears, after the commune has been cast, she leaves behind a potion of heroism in a beautiful bottle.
    

  

- The Arachnid Labyrinth is the most direct path to the Einzbern’s temple. Navigating it is a Skill Challenge, requiring 6 successes to correctly navigate. 
    

The region is layered in spider webs and smaller arachnid entities. The party passes by an ancient iron helmet and armour and weapons, long rusted, layered in spider webs.

- If 3 failures are incurred, the character leading the party when the final failure is made trips and falls down a long downward path. A DC 15 dexterity save must be made to resist being tangled up in spiderwebs along the ground.
    

If the check is failed, the character is restrained (Escape DC 14), and a pair of giant spiders will crawl out and attack the entangled victim.

- There is a ruined fortress a short walk left of the camp. The fortress 
    

THE FOUNDING EINZBERNS

The group of knights that make up the seven founding members of the Einzberns made their home in a grand temple to Lathander and fortress during the age of Ascension. Their binding of Athelstan required the sacrifice of their afterlife, and the corruption of their bloodlines. They stole holy light and bound it to their descendants - syphoning power to the Urd tree that binds Athelstan, and stealing power from him.

The founding Einzberns are as follows:

- Syr Riemann Maine. Bald, tall, axe wearing human. Sirkonian, more gentle, deep voice but jolly and tries to bolster his friends.
    
- Syr Elizabeth Curte. Well built young woman with black hair and an ashy patch. British and proper sounding, but not proper in her mannerisms.
    
- Syr Lathran Murke. A wizard of long black hair with silver tips, the old Aasimar was responsible for the spell’s design that would allow the Vessel of Avarice to be used to imprison the fey that used it to ascend. He bears a wise tone and is a true devout follower of Lathander
    
- Syr Lorian Foltran. Short black hair and moustached human with serious tone. Strong and certain in his mannerisms
    
- Syr Tristan Renwillow. Golden locks and a light build wearing an ornate breastplate and a blade at his side. Happy but also serious when the time calls for it.
    
- Syr Jerrit Marlow. Dwarf of maul-wielding stature. He has extremely long black hair and a very well adorned beard. He has a tired air about how he speaks.
    
- Syr Sigfried Einsbern. Short, tamed hair. Middle age. Longsword at his back and armoured pauldrons atop hard leather fittings and chainmail and metal. His right pauldron is adorned with a wolf’s head insignia. He has a greatsword on his back.
    

BIRTHPLACE OF THE EINZBERNS LAYOUT AND ENCOUNTERS

1. Entrance courtyard/bridge. Entryway with two large towers overlooking a massive front area. There is a balcony and walls and a door. The door appears sealed. There are a smattering of crystals around the area. When someone inspects the door, the crystals will glow and from out of them will burst 3d6 crystal blights (needle blights).
    

Encounter: Crystal blights. 1d4 crystal blights will join the fray every round until the doors are opened and sealed.

11 HP each.

Tower’s loot. Atop the far right tower, past the destroyed stairway, there is a skeleton with an almost totally destroyed set of armour, but there lies a +1 Bow that is of beautiful carved wood. The upkeep of the leather handle is degraded, and the string is broken, but the bow itself is of beautiful construction. There is a bone carving above the handle of a wolf’s head. The bow is named “Howl” and when an arrow is fired from it a gentle howl of a wolf can be heard. Attacks from the weapon deal thunder damage.

The door can be opened by lighting the fires on top of the watchtowers, or by forcing it open.

2. Entryway and great corridor. Meeting rooms, basic chambers with degraded tables.
    

Similarly there is an upstairs barracks containing what appears to be living quarters, a viewing balcony.

3. Ruined stables. There was a cave-in in this area. The stables are mostly underground but a horse’s skeleton can be found from sifting around. There is a scroll of animal friendship and a scroll of seaming.
    
4. Hallway. Beyond a pair of giant iron walls the dungeon shows its feywild influence more. There are crystalline roots growing in many of the surfaces. 
    

There is a trap: A pair of scythes that swings down when a pressure plate is pressed. It can be avoided entirely with a DC 15 dexterity saving throw, noticed with a DC 18 perception check. If unavoided it will deal 3d10 slashing damage.

5. Worship Chamber. This chamber of prayer is heavily bled into by the feywild. 
    

There are roots growing along the walls and floor and ceiling. There is a vision of Lorian and Lathran discussing the ritual to come. In the vision, the roots that shield the viewing well are gone. 

Beside the viewing well there is what seems to be a scroll of divine favour. 

Within the well, there is a golden shortsword, it hums with magical energy and gives off a holy aura, but it appears to not be a weapon. It slots into the MAD DEVA’s SCABBARD.

6. Passage corridor
    
7. Myrmidon Guard chamber
