**GENERAL NOTES**
- Banahras 1st around 11:30
- In battle with Aerondite
- In the cathedral of [[Kenifria]]

**Aerondite**
Once defeated, Aerondite will rise from her stone form, restored as a beautiful feminine planetar in a phoenix-like flare of power. She will look upon the vanguard and realize her mistake. 
- If Kanan used the [[Daybreakers]], she will take his hand in hers and kiss his cheek and a radiance will flow around him and they will regain their use.
- She knows of [[Siegfried Einzbern]]'s fate.
