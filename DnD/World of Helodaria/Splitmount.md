# Description
On the outskirts of the [[Platinum Highroad]] sits a medium sized farming village, with grain fields to the south and open grasses to the east. The village of Splitmount is situated in a valley between two mountain ranges, roughly separated by 6km of river covered mountains, to the north and to the south. The valley persists for around 12 or 13km until opening.

The valley is mostly green, semi-kept grasses, with a river winding through. The open areas are used to keep cattle, and the southern end of the village opens to a larger field, used to grow grains.

The town is quite large, with rather high quality lifestyles and a strong guard force. The entrances and side of the town away from the mountain have some remnants of a wall, along with a few unfinished fences. There are 3 guard outposts around the valley, 1 southwest, and two to the east and southeast, the furthest east one was endangered by the orcs at the ruins of a fortress that has since been cleared out.
# History
- At some point around 813PF, the [[Vanguard]] and the [[Ashen Legion]] battled with and defeated a war party of orcs. This battle is known as the [[Battle of Splitmount]].
