A young, slightly bearded female dwarf with her eyebrows incinerated off. Gentle in tone but strict on her business. Lund was born in [[Steinwalde]] and made her way south to get away from her family. Lund knows about the Steinefni mining outpost that can be found at the source of the river, as the dwarves that pass through Strahldale for supplies have confided in her over time, or she pieced it together.
