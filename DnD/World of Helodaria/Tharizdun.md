Tharizdun is a truly primordial being. A god of eternal, suffocating depths and void that fills them, Tharizdun appears not in the crashing of waves but in the coldness of the waters, the pressure of the depths and nothingness of the open ocean.
# Details
## Titles
- Void Eternal
## Appearance
Tharizdun's appearance is that of an octopus with uncountable, writhing arms shrouded in inky darkness, such that the boundaries between god and void are unknowable. His size is immense, and many think that his darkness is his true form, and that it is that darkness that gives root to his influence on the world.
# Tenets and Teachings
In the way that Orcus knows that the chaos of life must be extinguished by him, Tharizdun has a primeval drive to extinguish anything that would indicate that existence ever took place. Where Orcus is intelligent in his goal of a dead universe, Tharizdun feeds off of nothingness, and in the multiverse being created, he has already failed. He has no tenets, only that void is certainty and that someday, even the dead will never have existed.
# Known Worshippers
Those who worship the ink god do not do so believing that he cares for them, but rather they see the inevitability of his spread.
