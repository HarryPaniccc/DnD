A beautiful republic of islands and coastal cities on the continent of [[Zitrumea]], Pyleas is capitalized by a city from which the nation takes its name. The mainland is surrounded by city islands and a landscape of plains and hills, as well as beautiful mountain ranges and high altitude plateaus. Stretching to the South East of the Republic, a great desert stretches along the coastline: A remnant of the ancient history of the continent.

The many city states that make up the Aegir Archipelago all offer trade and citizens to the wealthy republic, those who call it home range from beastfolk to human, many contributing to the overall society built around individualism and freedom.
