  - At will: Misty Step
  - Once per day each: Shadow of Moil*, Power Word Pain, Glibness, Plane Shift
  - "*Lucius casts this spell on himself at the start of combat"
actions:
  - name: Multiattack
    desc: Lucius makes two slam attacks.
  - name: Slam
    desc: Melee attack; +11 to hit, 2d6 + 5 bludgeoning damage.
  - name: Bite
    desc: +11 to hit, 5ft against a willing or grappled/incapacitated/restrained creature. (1d6 + 4) piercing plus (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.
  - name: Charm
    desc: Lucius targets one humanoid he can see within 30 ft. of him. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack. Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
bonus_actions:
  - name: Helfire Rite
    desc: Both hands are ignited in a hellfire rite. When a hand is used in an attack while rited, the target suffers an additional 2d8 fire damage, and creatures within 5 ft. of the target of the attack suffer 2d8 + 4 fire damage.
legendary_actions:
  - name: Aether Dash
    desc: Lucius steps into the border ethereal, traversing as though using a blood hunter's Aether Step, and moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks. After he finishes moving, he returns to the material plane.
  - name: Attack
    desc: Lucius makes one slam attack.
  - name: Wrathflight (Costs 2 Actions)
    desc: Lucius summons his bat wings and beats them. Each creature within 10ft. of him must succeed on a DC 19 dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 + 5 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Lucius can then fly up to his movement speed. He loses his flying speed after finishing this movement.

#### Chalice lair actions
On initiative count 20. They happen in order like villainous actions.
- Cast wall of fire surrounding itself. Concentration is held by Lucius
