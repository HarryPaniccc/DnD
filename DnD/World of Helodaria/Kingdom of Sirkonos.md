The Kingdom of Sirkonos is an ancient Kingdom on the continent of [[Eranulaid]]. It is the westmost civilisation on the continent, and has historical roots in a pre-[[The Fall|Fall]] civilisation

Old woods, teeming with older magics and eldritch curses. Walled towns, owned by paranoid barons, constantly on guard from external threats. A central stone city cowering in the shadow of a dark manor, patrolled by a dreadful legion, subtly enforcing their master's will.

Sirkonos is a realm of uncertainty, made of swamps, wastelands, and wilderness, protected by guilds of monster hunters and the forces of local sheriffs. Criminal organisations orchestrate murders and thefts while lonely wizard towers shy away from the dangerous socialscape in order to study the innate darkness of the land. The royal family has seeming all but forgotten about the rest of the country, all the while, the powerful vampires of Clan [[Vorciln]] are exerting their influence on those around them from their dark castle gateway to the outer planes.

### The Crown
The Sirkonian royal line is represented by deep purples and blues, rules from castle [[Leerehalt]], and bares the symbol of two dragons facing apart from one another with their mouths open. The royal lineage has their founding in the fall, where [[King Sirkon]] the first defended the ancient city of [[Diredahl]] from the hordes of [[Malar]] from the position of [[Don Murroc]], the Great Spire of the West.

# Geography

There are large dark forests and mires as well as wastelands to the east. To the west is more developable. To the far north is a great mountain range where orcs and dwarves and dragons live. Steinwalde is one of the first dwarven settlements, whose history can easily be followed 4000 years into the past. It is found in this mountain range - the Maghlas mountains.

## Eastern Wastes

The greatest scar left on Eranulaid from the ages of the fall, the Wastes was the site of a great battle that occurred during the god’s war. Old fortresses can still be found permeating the badlands, and under the swamps and forests lie chapels to the dark, forgotten gods.

Banespear mountain is a large, cursed peak, and was the site of great territorial conquest during the great battles. The mountain has many permutations of magics that have flowed through it in the years past, and has dark secrets hidden within.

Travel through the wastes takes roughly 4 times as long due to the dangerous nature of the landscape alone: rivers, ravines, cliff faces and natural hazards all slow cross-country travel to a great extent, and the roads that do exist zigzag and double back on themselves as to secure a safer path away from the monstrosities and the terrain. A ranger with the favoured terrain of swamp, forest and wasteland can receive benefits from 2 of their favoured terrains in order to have the wastes act as a normal area.
## Aldwyn Highlands

The wet highlands 

## Miletohr Wilds

The large stretch of wilderness and forestry in the foothills of the Maghlas Mountains, north of Leerehalt. The woods are known to bear many curses.

### The Sieleran River

The Sieleran River is a mineral-rich, blessed river that flows from the foothills of the Maghlas Mountains, out of the Ethfalian Caverns. It blesses much of the land surrounding it with bountiful soil and life, giving an almost feywild-like atmosphere near its banks. On occasion, one might find flowers that should be native to the fey growing on its banks.

  

The source of the Sieleran River is a beautiful cascade of waterfalls that come out of cracks in a sheer mountain slope, pooling deeply at the waterfalls base. Behind one of the larger falls, there is an opening that leads to the Ethfalian Caverns.

### Ethfalian Caverns

The Ethfalian Caverns are a large, mineral rich network of caves and tunnels that have formed around a region where the space between the feywild and material plane is thin. The crystals found in these caverns are greatly varied in their properties, and often form large reflective or even luminescent clusters. Many stretches of the caverns even have massive, entirely crystal pillars that resemble support beams that span 20 - 50 feet in length.

  

The realm between the feywild is thin in these caverns, growing thinner and thinner as one heads deeper. The Steinefni Mining company of Steinwalde has set up a walled section for the extraction of resources within the caverns, with a bridge that leads beyond a chasm that is never lowered, as beyond the chasm is deemed unsafe for excavation due to the weak barriers between the planes.

# Settlements

## Planning Section

Towns to introduce

- Nachtwand (night wand - town?)
    

## Steinwalde

One of the two great dwarf fortresses of old to survive the wars of the Fall, Steinwalde, or “the stone forest”, is a massive walled retreat set deeply in the heart of the [Redacted mountain name].

## Diredahl

The Capital City of Sirkonos, Diredahl is a giant, low lying, multi textural city that has survived for a time longer than the current age. As old as Leerehalt Keep itself, Diredahl is said to have been founded almost 1300 years ago by some scholars, but it's true age is not known.

  

The city proper is surrounded by a wall that reaches as high as 60 feet, hung well with royal banners and watched by Kronesguard. The city is layered, stretching higher in altitude the further West it stretches, as though it sprawled up a mountainous hillscape to soak in the rising sun from the East. Dead in the centre, surrounded by a fortress of hard stone base and walls and iron, jutting out from the landscape like 

  

The city is divided into districts: The Red district, the Blue district, the Sun district and the Moon district. The sources of their names are ancient and it is not truly known, and the divisions of the districts are not set in stone. If you were to live in Diredahl for a year, you might gain an understanding of where one begins and another ends, but no one will be able to guide you as to where the boundaries are.

  

Notable Locations

- Don Murroc, The Great Spire of the West. An ancient tower at the centre of Diredahl, Don Murroc has a history shrouded in warfare, in unity and in salvation. It is said that during the great walls of the Fall, King Sirkon the first, before he had his crown, held the invaders of the great City of Diredahl from all sides by setting legendary archers on the battlements of Don Murroc, and having his people shelter inside. Though the city was taken, the spire was not, and with only twenty archers under his command, King Sirkon fended off the hoards that were beset on the city, and Sirkonos found its name, and its first king.  
      
    The spire stands at a magnificent height, rising above the apex of structures at the centre of the walled city, within a fortress structure that sits like an iron rose at the centre of the city. The top is a grand viewing platform, from which one can see all around for miles, with good enough eyes you could see Keldmire on a clear day. Around the structure are battlements, balconies, and stairways that all interlink into an intensely complex structure.

## Port Eidenspear

Port Eidenspear is the large port city on the southern shore of Sirkonos. It is the largest city in the kingdom other than Diredahl. Eidenspear is culturally the most vibrant city in Sirkonos, trade vessels from all around the world using it either as a refreshment port or trading with it directly.

  

The city is situated in a large bay that is itself set into the mainland and leads into a river, the shores of which are made of tall rocky mountains. The majority of the city situates itself between the base of these mountains and the shoreline.

  

Notable Locations

-   
    

## Fengate

The small mire-town of Fengate is located at the base of Banespear Mountain. The gentle swamps made for comfortable living conditions for a small group of farmers, but it only saw growth after a vein of tin and silver was found around 730 PF. Since then the village has seen a strong mining export.

  

The surrounding mire is mostly only travelable on the main roads with any form of efficiency, and a small forest surrounds the village. 

### Notable Locations

- The Western Watchtower is an old ruin that has been repurposed as a guard outpost within the forest to the north-west of the village. It provides a little bit of safety to travellers caught in the mire-woods after dark. Some of the sheriff’s men are always posted there.
    

- The Marketplace takes up the majority of the main road that connects the two entrances to the city. The majority of things that can be bought there. The muddy road is populated by stalls of fresh fruit and beer stalls and other commodities.
    

- The beer stall is run by a particularly stout dwarf with no hair and bushy eyebrows
    
- The butcher’s stall is run by an overweight human male of darker skin.
    
- The silverworker’s stall is run by a human woman of red hair and slight frame.
    
- There is a large General Trade stall run by a short haired tiefling man with strong red skin.
    

- The Spearpommel Inn is a small wooden structure a short distance into the main road. Small tavern and a bar, upstairs that boasts 4 rooms of moderate size. Run by Dunmer Eiseltan.
    

  

### Notable People

- Sheriff Burgon Ironclad. Dark brown furred Bugbear. He leads a small militia and takes taxes on the area. His men guard the walls of Fengate from attack. He has a great axe and chainmail. Gritty slight german accent.
    
- Dunmer Eiseltan Innkeep of the Spearpommel Inn. Rouner, Short dark hair. Higher Sirkonian accent
    
- Adelaide. Her mother owns a fruit stand. Red hair and a button nose and green eyes
    

## Ralia

## Keldmire

Home of the Einzberns. The city is largely paved and well structured, a mish mash of side alleys and central roads. Large arteries of pathways connect the main open areas with each other, while the smaller byways intersect almost all locations in the city just as well. The city works off of wine and farm trade.

  

There are many trees throughout the area, and a couple markets.

### Notable Locations

- The Marketplace. Bustling as ever, the low-lying marketplace is half-covered in a roof of leaves from the oak trees that are found around it. At the centre of the city, this is where most people would have passed through when going through the town, so there are many inns and taverns laced throughout it.
    
- Die Zwei Hunde. Low lying tavern run by Heinirich Fibblethumb. It has a bar and some upstairs rooms, as well as a secret underground hiding place hidden behind a large barrel by means of a complicated contraption in the walls.
    
- Theatre House. The theatre has been converted into a bar and tavern of sorts for Sheriff Sorezo’s men, with Sorezo living in the manor itself. No one has staged a play in a long time.
    
- Schrute’s Alchemy. A relatively tight space given who owns it. Shrute constantly has to be slouched, and behind the counter is actually dug a little bit lower to accommodate the firbolgs height. There is an attached greenhouse.
    
- Einzbern Manor. Dilapidated in the years after the Inquisition, it is now being watched quite consistently by the Vorciln. The place is a labyrinth of knowledge and a deathtrap for those who are unprepared to enter. A rusted iron fence surrounds the grounds, and atop a hill stands the old manor.
    

### Notable Characters

- Heinrich Fibblethumb. Owner and runner of the Zwei Hunde. Gnome of long white hair usually in a bun, and a gentle beard. Caring and sometimes stern.
    
- Shrute. Owner of Shrute’s Alchemy. Large slightly yellow-green firbolg. Deep and slow of tone, and is respected by many of the community
    
- Markus Serezo - deceased. Think physicality of doomfist. Voice of a deeper J'zargo. He is an oni in disguise. He is currently acting as sheriff to Keldmire, keeping the profits of the town for himself and his goons. He always has a pair of Hollow Guardians with him. The form he wears gives the suspicion of an orc in its lineage, maybe two or three generations removed. 
    

## Brocia

The southern forests stretch sparsely into the city limits on the southern side. The structure is mostly well developed stonework on the interior, as the forest has dangers that people do not want to brave outside of the walls. 

  

The primary trade of the city is an influx of raw material from the wastes. It essentially operates as the main trade route between the capital and the resource rich wastes.

## Strahldale

Outside the northmost border of Sirkonos, squeezed between an ancient northern forest, the eastern wastes, and the Maghlas mountains, sitting comfortably on a gentle section of the foothills, is the quiet farming village of Strahldale. One of the calmest places in Sirkonos, Strahldale’s grazing fields rarely see a year without bountiful grazing. As such, and due to crop fields being too difficult to maintain on the slopes, Strahldale has become a very potent agricultural powerhouse. Although the chill in the winters descending from the mountains means that large barns need to be constructed to keep the animals warm and safe, Strahldale sees many furs, skins, meats and other animal products being exported throughout the harvest seasons.

  

The mineral water from the Efthalian Cave flows down the Sieleran River through the foothills north of the village, and collects in the White Lake south of the village. To the east, one can see the wastes, and to the west, a large, dark stretch of wilderness known as the Miletohr Wilds.

### Notable Locations

- Shöppe. Owned by Strudel and his with Merideth.
    
- Trading Market. A myriad of trades goods are sold around town, but they are mostly what 
    
- Central Rivers. Running through the village, entering from the top of the wall and splitting into multiple smaller streams, a beautiful, pure mineral water river runs through the town, originating from the 
    
- Smithy. Lunds smithy a weapons/armour shop. Lund had been well trained in her home city, but doesn't often get a chance to work with heavy materials to forge what she was taught to, so any opportunity she is glad to make something big. For a price.
    

### Notable Characters

- Shöppekeep Strudel. Elderly, not all there gnomish man. Manic in speech and not consistent speech patterns
    
- Blacksmith Lund. A young, slightly bearded female dwarf with her eyebrows incinerated off. Gentle in tone but strict on her business. Lund was born in Steinwald and made her way south to get away from her family. Lund knows about the Steinefni mining outpost that can be found at the source of the river, as the dwarves that pass through Strahldale for supplies have confided in her over time, or she pieced it together.
    
- Sheriff Thron. A rounder and heavier man than most, Thron is cold and focussed on his work, but kind to the children of Strahldale. He is bald and low eyed, and deep of voice. Thron is experienced in combat; in his youth he was part of an adventuring party who used to hunt lycans and other beasts of the sirkonian wastes for bounties.
