The Faces are a mercenary group stationed in [[Vasspryg]], known for taking on harder bounties than the rest of the groups that center around the town. They had a rough patch before, coming under the mental control of the [[Knights of Malevolence]], as [[Tiwrath the Blue]] mind controlled them into doing his bidding.

Most recently, they have been spending time working alongside the [[Imperial Arcanists]] in hunting down rogue mages.
