A deity residing in the fortress of memories within the Shadowfell, the Raven Queen collects and protects souls and other, interesting things that represent personality, things that bring her once shattered mind comfort. She holds dominion over souls and death. She is worshipped by those who have lost someone or wish for serenity that comes with less attachment.

Her Fortress of Memories is a place of solemnness, containing countless souls that have been taken into the care of the Raven Queen. She believes that souls should be cared for after death, and that as your life ends you should be given the rest that you deserve. Her goals are to extract essence and memories of these souls, also collecting other trinkets from throughout the multiverse, all of them held and carefully tended to by her ravens. This is not to gain power, but is rather an almost childish fascination, and desire to protect and care for them.

## Appearance
The Raven Queen is a more abstract being than the other gods, appearing often as a collection of ravens or as signs. Her true form is that of a young, dark haired woman wearing shadows as garments. Underneath her usual, expressionless mask she is quite beautiful.
## Birth of the Raven Queen
During the Fall, a powerful Elven Sorceress Queen, in an attempt to unite the houses of her people and the gods that ruled over them began rituals in an attempt to elevate herself to godhood. A group of zealots, wanting to take her new divine power for themselves, interrupted the last of these rituals, moving all present, the Sorceress, her devout followers, and themselves to the [[Shadowfell]]. The now-Goddess, in the confusion and pain of her shattered mind, clutched to her existence with all of her power, and almost forgot all of who she was. Thus, [[The Raven Queen]] was born. The other gods, viewing this act as a potential threat to their power, destroyed the means for this ritual to be repeated, and banished the memory of the Queenâ€™s true name from all mortal minds and history.
# Tenets and Teachings
> - The natural progression of all life is for the soul to peacefully move on. To hold on to your soul unnaturally is perverse and evil.
> - Undeath is a plague on this world. Destroy these malformations so that their souls may find peace, should they deserve it.
> - Love those nearing the end of their lives. Do not be sorrowful, for their soul will continue to live in the care of the Raven Queen.
