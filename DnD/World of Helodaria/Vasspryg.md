# Description
Well governed by the republic, Vasspryg is a medium sized stronghold city, home to a mining and timber trade hub, along with a healthy merchant presence. Its position North makes for a colder than average climate, but its further distance from the Mungandr Lake means that it is warmer than Ironbase.

It is seated comfortably on the low beginnings of a mountain, and surrounded by woodland to the south and east. The path forks around half a kilometre west of town in order to avoid the town, going through the farming outskirts area, and meets in the middle of the forest east of town. The relatively averagely lying skyline of Vasspryg is penetrated by a dramatic grey geometry of flat masonry with a few extension towers poking out of it. The road through Vasspryg leads across a bridge, and out of town through the east woodland. North pathways lead to the mines, mainly iron and copper, and the south part of the town on the base of the mountain uses the river to turn lumber from the forest to usable timber. South of the river are a few grain farms and cattle farms that keep Vasspryg well fed.

The stronghold is divided into multiple areas. The north most of these is the *Ivory district*, the generally upper-class area of the city, it is small and surrounded by a small wall that separates it from the rest of the city. That isn’t to say access is exclusive. Within are higher class noble’s residences, such as [[Martin Proushe]]’s manor. The Ruins Retreat Tavern is a large, well known tavern for adventurers within the ivory district.

The next area is a mostly upper-middle class district, the *Market district* is home to many of the residences of Vasspryg, and most of the inns as well. Many of the businesses here are tailored to adventurers, but all kinds of wares can be bought for many prices. The trading guilds of the republic are quite influential here. 

The *Portsman’s district* is a smaller district where most industrial work is done. Warehouses, cobblers and all forms of handiwork trade are conducted here.

# Locations
## Ivory District
- The **Trioculary** is a primarily marble square in the centre of the Ivory district which houses the three major buildings of the city, the [[Cathedral of the Bahumat]], the [[Ixalan Complex]] and the Town hall. The area is raised up and surrounded by statues depicting gods and great leaders of the Republic. In the centre there is a fountain with four statues. Facing the Ixalan complex is a statue of [[Ixalan the Harrowed]]. He wields a staff and a sword, with eight keystones on his arms. Facing the town hall is the scholar and once-member of the [[Uldronos Council]], [[Ordenix Hardtoe]]. Despite his name, he is a very serious dwarven gentleman who helped forge the laws of [[Republic of Ruina|Ruina]]. Facing the Cathedral is a statue depicting the armour of a Lawbearer warden, symbolising that no one man in the order of worship is greater than another, and that together the temple of the Pantheons is strong. In the centre of the fountain is a statue cast in pure silver, depicting the dragon [[Harrix]], as he held a key part in founding Vasspryg.
- The **Ruins Retreat Tavern** is a very large adventurer based inn where everyone looking for adventure and kinship in Vasspryg goes. It has a large central raised stage and two balcony floors above the central tavern room. It is owned by [[Jaris]] the half orc ex-adventurer.
- The **[[Ixalan Complex]]**. A tall skyscraper like building made of grey, marble like stone which is decorated by windows and sigils which act as a myriad of defences. There are many offset spires that fork out as you look further up. The exterior is surrounded by an artificial square pond with water that can be walked on. The complex acts as a base for the [[Imperial Arcanists]] , a guild who work under the empire and oversee the magical aspects of Ruina.
- The **town hall.** A large, old building made up of stone and dark wood. This building houses the guard and is a base for all of the guard captains and the guard steward. The design is reminiscent of the other guard halls but much larger.
- The **[[Cathedral of the Bahumat]]** looks like the Pantheon in France but with chairs for sermon. The walls are decorated with tapestries of the gods and with the history of the lawbearers. Outside there are always 2 lawbearers stationed at the entrance and there are more along the balconies

## Market District
- The **Clock Tower** is a structure 20ft x 20ft about 10 meters high with one of the few clocks in Ruina, and a bell tower. It is kept working by time keeper [[Eluhou]]
- The **Waking Giant** inn is owned by [[Fork]]. It is a comfortable inn that is essentially the enhanced sleeping giant from Skyrim
- The **Choc and Chisel**. Blacksmiths owned by [[Tiffany Axe]] and his loxodon friend [[Bizook Harty]]. Makes high quality weapons and items for adventurers.
- The **New Writs**. Bookshop/library. Around the size of the Bishops library. Owned and run by human [[Valfite]]. Usually stocks arcane books and scrolls, as many adventurer types pass through Vasspryg, but the history of the area can be found there as well.
## Portsman's District
- The **Sprig tap** is an alchemical supply shop with a stoner dwarf as the owner. They are not visited much, but have access to the more exciting type of items.
- **Order of the Lotus Safehouse**: A medium single room home in the market district. There are beds and food stores, along with a basement with a dojo and weapon racks. The building is protected against divination and is a well kept secret.
- **The Gravis Estate**. A large property in the Ivory district, the home to a large guard force and the base of House Gravis outside of Allhaven.
