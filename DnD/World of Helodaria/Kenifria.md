Kenifria is the birthplace of the Einzberns, a lost temple to [[Lathander]] where the [[Einzberns]] were created by [[Siegfried Einzbern]].

# Dungeon Layout
#### 1. Entrance Courtyard/Bridge
An Entryway with two large towers overlooking a massive front area. There is a balcony and walls and a door. The door appears sealed. There are a smattering of crystals around the area. When someone inspects the door, the crystals will glow and from out of them will burst 3d6 crystal blights (needle blights).

**Encounter**: Crystal blights. 1d4 crystal blights will join the fray every round until the doors are opened and sealed. 11 HP each.

**Tower’s loot**. Atop the far right tower, past the destroyed stairway, there is a skeleton with an almost totally destroyed set of armour, but there lies a +1 Bow that is of beautiful carved wood. The upkeep of the leather handle is degraded, and the string is broken, but the bow itself is of beautiful construction. There is a bone carving above the handle of a wolf’s head. The bow is named “[[Howl]]”.

**Einzbern Vision**: [[Kanan Einzbern]] will have a vision of [[Lorian Foltran]] and [[Riemann Maine]] discussing the ritual to come.

#### 2. Temple Hallway
This grand hallway is the primary fore chamber to the temple as a whole. The structure is made from a dark grey chiselled stone. A short stairway leads down into the main hallway, where a set of pillars holds the great structure up. A pair of huge statues depicting heavily armoured knights with the symbol of [[Lathander]] on their plate mail, with axes in their hands, watch over the entrance.

- **A DC 15 investigation check** reveals that the knights also have the symbol of a wolf's head on their axes

There are signs of the ages along the walls and ground, areas of collapse from the temple's walls, and the beginnings of facades to walls that might have since crumbled from the ages.

- **Stairways to the barracks**: A pair of stairways lead to the staying rooms on the second floor. 
- **Chest**: Beside the east-most stairway, behind a wall, there sits a chest with a wolf's head on the face of the latch. The chest opens if tried, but it is trapped with a sigil on the floor in front of it. A **DC 18 Perception check identifies the sigil** as a glyph of warding. It will trigger when the chest is opened, exploding in a 20 foot radius, forcing a **DC 18 Dexterity saving throw** for 5d8 thunder damage on a fail, half as much on a success.
	- Within the chest there lies a *scroll of animal friendship*, a *scroll of divine favour*, and various rolls of carpets and linens, ancient, but untouched due to the protection of the chest, worth 100Gp in total.
- **A stairway** leads to the feasting hall, area 3.
- **Statues**: 
#### Upstairs
Small rooms of beds and chests, living spaces, separated by hallways. There is a balcony with a hole in the stone walls that leads outside due to Silb.
#### 3. Feasting Hall, Kitchen, and Pantry
A rather large feasting hall, maybe 40ft long, sporting a table at the centre, able to maybe fit 30 people at one gathering comfortably. On the opposite end of the room sits a fireplace, no ash at all in its mouth. On the left side of the room there is an opening into another room, looks like a pantry.

- **Table** on far right corner with 3 silver chalices each worth 10Gp

The pantry is in a similar state to the kitchen, with another stairway downwards that leads into a dark cellar. Motion through this room sends echoes down the cellar stairway.

**The cellar** is a multi-rowed storage space, left mostly empty after the abandonment of the temple. A **DC 15 perception check** will locate in the back corner a shrine of sorts to [[Lathander]]. The rising sun set in carved steel has collected dust. Around it hangs a small pendant: what appears to be a silver pendant and chain, perfectly preserved, with little carvings in it that are meaningless but pleasing to look at.

**ENCOUNTER: 1 x BARREL MIMIC**
Next to the shrine are a pair of barrels with the same symbol of a wolf on them. The leftmost barrel is a mimic.

**Loot**: Around the shrine, there is:
- [[Medallion of Intuition]]: +1 to insight checks
- 3 golden and silver coins that are about 5cm in diameter. The silver is rusted and tarnished, softened with age, but the treasure is worth 50Gp a piece
#### 4. Portcullis entrance

- **Secret door** at the end of the room. Touching the wall will reveal a mural of two wolves, one looking towards the sun and one looking towards the moon. In celestial, the phrase :"*Wisdom of one is valuable. Wisdom of the sister aids the one. Speak her name so that we might meet.*"
	- The solution is "Sehanine"
- 
#### 5. Secret meeting chamber
**Loot**: Chest at the end of the room containing a small coffer of 500Gp, a *scroll of divine favour*, and a *keystone* that will come in handy at the bridge to the prison (Area 15)

There is also an iron key that will unlock most of the small doors present in the dungeon unless otherwise stated.
#### 6. Aerondite's Hallway
The great iron doors in the hallway open into a 15ft wide corridor with signs of roots poking through the stone floor. On the opposite end of the room, beyond two opposite doors on either wall, stands a statue of a female form, chiselled in grey stone, angelic wings outstretched. She wears a light dress, leaving her shoulders and arms bare which shows that she is really quite toned in build. She holds a lantern of mechanical design in her outstretched left hand, and a mace in the other.

To the left leads to a prayer chamber that has become desecrated by the feywild corruption. Crystals grow in large chunks throughout the chamber. At the centre of the far wall, there is a singular large red glowing crystal entangled in roots that block passage to the next room.

**ENCOUNTER: Escalating crystal blights.**
Someone getting close the the crystal on the far wall will cause the the room to shake and the roots to retract around the crystal, forming a 25HP shield that needs to be destroyed.

Each round on initiative count 20 blights will spawn until the crystal they are protecting is destroyed.
- 2 Crystal blight minions will spawn and attack whoever is closest
- 4 Will spawn the next round as crystals grow around them
- 4 +1d4 subsequently.

**Holy pool**: 
There is a pool of holy water in the circular chamber beyond the roots. The stone room has beautiful white streaks of light from the pool reflected all around, as the pool gives of a gentle silver glow. 
- This is one of the locations where **Aerondite's Golden Sword** can be found
- One can dredge up 3 vials of holy water before the pool loses its holy property
- There is a [[Gem of Brightness]] that has formed from the feywild's corruption at the bottom of the pool giving of a gentle pinkish glow.

> A stairway beyond a locked iron gate leads to area 8. (DC 15 to open)

**Hall of the Crusades**:
**There is a trap**: A pair of scythes that swings down when a pressure plate is pressed. It can be avoided entirely with a DC 15 dexterity saving throw, noticed with a DC 18 perception check. If unavoided it will deal 3d10 slashing damage.

**Encounter: flame myrmidon**
A flame myrmidon, casting gentle, fire-like light will be wandering through this hallway as a patrol. **A perception check will reveal their footsteps in the dust**.

The history of the Kenifrian Knights is on display here. It displays:
1. A group of armoured paladins raising their swords to the sun
2. Two crusades are displayed. First is against demonic powers. Second against a horde of undead figures.
3. The third crusade takes up the last third of the wall. Athelstan stands like a shadow over the knights looking towards him.
   Loss is depicted, bleeding knights and burning villages
   Then a heavily armoured cloaked man holds a chalice high above his head, and the mural is abruptly ended. It was never finished.

A **DC 20 investigation check** reveals that the sun in the first image acts as gear-like mechanism. It will open a secret panel which reveals a large chest with 2000Gp worth of treasure, chalices, and fine linens. It also contains a beautiful +1 longsword, as well as a [[Howl]].

#### 7. Myrmidon watch chamber
This stone room sports small pillars, just large enough for a medium creature to hide behind, as well as a stairway that leads up to the left into area 8 beyond a wooden door.

**ENCOUNTER: 3x flame myrmidons**
#### 8. Lathran's Study
A wide study space, with tables covered in open books and various arcane looking instruments, as well as alchemical tools - all rendered useless by the ages. The far wall opens with 3 arches into a massive, ruined Cathedral. A lectern sits somewhat isolated from the rest of the furniture. 

- **Arcane table corner**. There is a spell crafting corner with a table with various arcane runes and sigils carved into it. There is still latent magics present in the table, and by using a 3rd level spell slot, a spellcaster can cast *scrying* using the table for free. The table loses its magic after that.
- **Lectern**: A shadowy mist pours from the book on the lectern. Once someone approaches, the book will fling open and the ink of the pages will fly out and animate into an **Allip**. Once defeated, the book will become legible again.
##### **Book**. The book is a spell tome containing the following spells:
- Soul Cage (6th necromancy)
- Banishment
- Planar Binding
- Magic Circle

as well as various rune work and symbols. The development of the Einzbern brand is here too. The book contains information on **The Urd Tree** as well as a solar map of the feywild. Information on the [[Einzberns|Einzbern]] curse is rich in here.
##### Vision
Syr [[Lathran Murke]] (Black wizard) and Syr [[Lorian Foltran]] will discuss the ritual going forward as Lathran finishes his preparations.
- Prep is complete
- Lorian is doubting if it is worth discarding his faith
- Lathran urges that sacrifice comes in many forms
- Lathran takes the branding iron with the symbol
- Now we wait for Sigfried to arrive. Let us join our brothers and sisters below, one last time.
#### 9. Cathedral
A vast cathedral chamber, lit gently by fungal and crystal light. The once-tiled floor is cracked open with roots and crystals. The beautiful masonry of the structure has eroded incredibly over time, parts of ceiling have caved in, and some of the wall's facades have collapsed.
##### Statue
Saint [[Aerondite]], imprisoned in statue form, is on display in the hallway, missing her golden shield and golden sword. **Restoring the sword and shield to her is the only way to have her reanimate.** The statue has crack-like tears streaming down her face.

Aerondite is the sworn defender of Kenifria, but in the ages since her oath was taken, and after Sigfried succumbed to vampirism, her vision of duty would have failed. She has succumbed to a small degree of madness.

**ENCOUNTER: 6 X Basilisks**

Upon returning to the cathedral after leaving it, there are 6 basilisks sleeping around a *fallen column*. 
- They have a **passive perception of 9**

**ENCOUNTER: Aerondite, the mad deva + 2 flame myrmidons + 2 archers**
If Aerondite's shield and sword are returned to her grasp, her body will animate, and the cracks from her tears will spread around her form. 

> Placing the items in the hands of the angel, her hands curl around their handles. A moment passes... The tears, the cracks forming around her eyes begin to spread and web around her entire body, some with gentle orange and yellow glows protruding from beneath. Her arms come unfrozen and she falls to the ground, dropping her weapons.

- Aerondite will be slightly confused, but will immediately be hostile to the party, but will not attack
>"Who... who are you? Defilers! What are you doing in Kenifria?"

- If Aerondite can be persuaded to be pacified, a spell like *Greater Restoration* or of 5th level with a similar effect will cause her cursed statue-like state to be 

- If Aerondite attacks, her weapons will fly into her hands and she will slam her shield into the ground, turning parts of the center of the cathedral to lava about 3 feet deep

- The lava, if fallen into, deals very *10d10 fire damage*

> "NO! You have come to plunder and desecrate my home! LET ME SHOW YOU WHY HERETICS FEAR THE DAWN."

If Aerondite is killed, her stone body will fall and her true spirit form will rise from it
##### Vision

- Nobles, knights, warriors
- One by one hush and they all bow as heavy footsteps enter
- Sigfried with cloak, sword on back, satchel, maul dripping and being polished
- Calls a squire
- He looks to Lathran
#### 10. Bathing Pool
- Rejuvenating water flows through this bathing pool. Taking 10 minutes to soothe oneself in the water while nude *restores 2 expended hit dice*
- A character that acts hostile to the area
#### 11. Entrance to Prison Wing
#### 12. Hallway
Corruption from the feywild grows more present heading in this direction.
#### 13. Workshop
Tables with various construction implements decorate this room, all of which are covered in a thick layer of dust and cobwebs, to the point that breathing in here is even slightly more strenuous. Implements of craft lay scattered around this ancient workshop. A single door on the opposite side of the room lies closed.
#### 14. Scribing Room
This room is filled with 8 lecterns, some with long destroyed ink still in their holders, others with half-scribed books, long ruined by the ages. There is thick dust and even thicker cobwebs lining the walls.
#### 14. Prison Antechamber
On the south side of this large chamber there is a collapsed pathway that would have lead to another wing of Kenifria, and what would have been the main entrance for the prison further in. A pair of great iron doors held shut prevent further traversal into the prison wing
#### 16. Corpse Flower Garden
There are three braziers around the area with burning fires in them, remaining after the ages. The area has signs of garden-like growth, as well as a few graves on the ground.

- Putting the fires out causes a smell to spread through the area. The players recognise it to smell like a corpse flower

**ENCOUNTER: Corpse Flower** x1
- Putting all of them out will cause a corpse flower made of graves to pop out of the ground and attack, revealing a **secret chest** behind where it was resting
##### Loot:
The beautifully crafted chest behind the corpse flower contains:
- A *scroll of death ward*
- A *scroll of invisibility*
- A *scroll of aura of vitality*
