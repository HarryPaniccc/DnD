Mystra is the Lawful Neutral Goddess of magic and the weave of magic. The patron of wizards and sorcerers, as well as those who seek to understand the weave and the beauty of magic, Mystra was born sometime during the [[History of Helodaria#The Unknowable Age|Unknowable Age]], as the weave's coming into existence brought with it a consciousness, creating the Lady of Magic.

Mystra is said to be a manifestation of cosmic balance. Her champions on the material plane often act as instrumental advisors to great powers in times of world-changing events.
