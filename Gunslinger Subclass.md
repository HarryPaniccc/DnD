#### Gambit of Preference

#### Gunslinger Calibre
Careful marksmen, bombastic outlaws, and crafty scoundrels are all unique embodiments of what a gunslinger means - whether that be aggressive mobility, reliance on accuracy, or supplementing already lethal weaponry with the force of black powder. Choose one of the following Calibres, which best suites your character's playstyle. You can swap out your Calibre when you level up.

##### Outlaw
When you take this Calibre, you embody the thrill of the draw and the speed of combat. You learn the *Deadshot* Gambit, and when you roll a die to reload a firearm and roll the maximum amount possible you may make an attack with that weapon as part of the same action.

Scoundrels see the potency of firearms as an excellent way to complement their skills with other weapons. You gain the *Pressure* Gambit, and every time you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may pay one action in reload cost of a firearm that you have equipped.

### Flinching Gambit (this is incredibly underpowered)
When you take the attack action on your turn, you can use a firearm that an enemy has seen be fired to make that enemy flinch - fearful of the power of black powder. A creature within 30ft. of you must make a Wisdom saving throw unless they are immune to being frightened. On a failed save, the target flinches and the next attack against that creature has advantage. As part of the Gambit you can shoot the same enemy if the firearm is loaded.
### Pressing Gambit
When you gain this Gambit you no longer have disadvantage on attacks made with firearms against creatures within 5ft. of you. In addition, when you hit a creature with a melee attack you may draw, attack the creature with, and stow a firearm (no action required). You don't add your ability modifier to this attack.
### Concussive Powder
