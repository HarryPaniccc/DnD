**Dagon** is the [[Primordials|Primordial]] of evil and the cause of the corruption of [[Tharizdun]] in the modern age. He is the reason the [[Abyss]] was formed, the first of the [[Demons]]. He was banished to the [[Far Realm]] at the end of the [[Dawn War]], as his power could not be destroyed or properly contained, but his whispers are still felt over the [[Planes of Existence]], and will be for eternity.

He is not a being or a god, or not like those with which most are familiar. He is a force of darkness, the inspiration of horrible acts and the natural tendency of the universe to destroy.
