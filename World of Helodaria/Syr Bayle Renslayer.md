Syr Renslayer is a Death Knight and the Sion of the Demon Lord [[Orcus]], and he has been [[King Sirkon]]'s general for as long as he has sat on the Sirkonian throne. Over history, Renslayer has been ruling a fort in the [[Nightshade Peaks]], east of the [[Sirkonos]], but as Sirkon's plan has come to fruition he has needed his closest advisor close at hand.

Renslayer is secretly envious and hateful of [[King Sirkon]], believing that his control over the forces of the [[Nightshade Peaks]] over the last thousand years after Sirkon's defeat have given him the right to reforge the world in his own image: one of conquest and death.

Renslayer is stern, does not have time for inferiors, and brutally efficient. *Adam Smasher*

He is affected by a permanent *Nystul's Magic Aura*, making him seem humanoid and alive. Renslayer famously ride [[Chiaross]], a dragon that appears to be an adult brass dragon, but is in truth a red affected by *Seeming* and *Nystul's Magic Aura*.
# History
Once the leader of the Armies of the [[Thay]] and protector of [[Desseran]], Renslayer marched against [[Sirkonos]] during [[The Fall]]. He was turned by [[King Sirkon]] alongside many. Later he was chosen by Orcus, maybe Orcus then Sirkon? Makes sense. Marched on the [[Nightshade Peaks]] and then later wanted to expand into Sirkonos.
