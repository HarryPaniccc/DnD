Some kind of [[Timeline]]
# Events summary to add

- Home of the first humans
- Desseran grows and people sale to [[Zitrumea]]
- Intermingling of races from [[Zitrumea]]
- [[Desseran Apostolate]] is formed and the avatars of [[Bahamut]], [[The Raven Queen]] and [[Lathander]]? Rule the west of [[Eranulaid]]. As an antagonistic force, [[Tiamat]] worship grows in modern [[Ruina]], [[Malar]] begins to etch warfare into the hearts of the beasts of the [[Maghlas Mountains]].
- God kings aided in saving them from the horrors of the [[Dawn War]] and the prior war and began to rule that way.
- ==The God Kings leave the material plane.== (Potential rewrite?)
- The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] are formed and corrupted with whispers of rebellion against their god-emperors by [[Dagon]], the [[Primordials|Primordial]] of evil, once thought banished after the [[Dawn War]] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zha4miIbPFg&t=419s) for history of Thay and inspiration.
- The wizards summoned a great number of demons and demonic forces to face against their god-kings so that they may have a society where wizards ruled. A demon lord was imprisoned by the god avatars and freed by the Thayans and used to lead the rebellion. [[Eltab]]
- They imprisoned Eltab again beneath [[Diredahl]] in [[Dun Murroc]] #TODO and successfully ousted the god rulers of [[Desseran]]
- From there the Empire of [[Thay]] spread across [[Eranulaid]]. Great cities were formed throughout the empire. It was a Magocracy.

### The Sundering of [[Thay]] occurs

- Thay split into smaller states
- Where Ruina now is became a sorcerer-supremist regime under the Malevolence
- The Zulkir Council ruled Desseran as they could, but were growing weaker as rebellion was inciting throughout the continent.

- After the break out of the Fall, Sirkon leads the sirkonians against the forces of [[Malar]] and the demonic forces under [[Tharizdun]] and becomes the first Sirkonian King.
- Sirkon becomes a lich after making a deal with [[Orcus]].
- His influence spreads across [[Thay]] like a creeping disease, growing his council of [[Lich|Liches]] and loyalists
- Some members of [[Thay]] rebel against him, seeing his rule as a sickness. By this point, the avatars of the [[Bahamut]] and of [[Lathander]] have reclaimed their roles as kings of Desseran. The avatar of [[The Raven Queen]] has spread her war East to Ruina.
- He finds and convinces [[Eltab]] to sacrifice himself so that he might use his heart, infusing it with the [[Seed of the Abyss]] to become the [[Heart of the Abyss]]. This would allow Sirkon command of the Demonic forces that had grown in the [[Nightshade Peaks]]. Orcus now sees him as an avatar of all of demonkind, a force meant to helm that which exists in the dark places of the world.
- His [[Red Wizards of Thay]] loyalists disappear to his side, leaving undiscovered doctrine that would cause future generations to be loyal to him.
- [[Syr Bayle Renslayer]] rides with an army alongside the avatars of the gods against the forces accumulating in the [[Nightshade Peaks]] against [[Desseran]] under Sirkon's power. He is defeated and turns to worship [[Orcus]], becoming his undying champion.
- Sirkon battles the avatar of [[Bahamut]], and the battle leaves the avatar nearly mortally wounded, but he rips out the [[Heart of the Abyss]] which causes Sirkon's followers to scatter, and the Demonic forces to become un-unified once again.
- [[Syr Bayle Renslayer]] leads the remaining forces of the [[Nightshade Peaks]] against the now-triumphant people of Desseran, and the people of Sirkonos are united under the Gods against the forces of evil that have ravaged their lands.
- With the [[Destroyer Gods]] defeated and imprisoned, the [[Creation Gods]] take leave of the [[Material Plane]] and go to their extraplanar homes.
- Sirkon's spirit is not destroyed, and he retreats to [[Leerehalt]] where somehow he begins the charade outside of the ire of the [[Creation Gods]]. He needs a new form that can once again wield the Heart.
- Renslayer remains in the [[Nightshade Peaks]] rebuilding in secret for the day that his Master Orcus may return. 
- Sirkon slowly reminds his forces, scattered, defeated and imprisoned, that there is no rule other than his. Now, almost a thousand years later, his return is beginning, as his avatar is perfected.


### Notes
- At some point during the age of ascension, the knights of Kenifria lead crusades against 1) a demon horde, 2) an undead encursion and 3) a crusade against [[Athelstan]]
