Saint Windguard was a follower of [[Ilmater]] whose heroism rose him up to sainthood. He protected [[Castle Sungrand]] at some point during the post fall age. There is a shrine to him under the chapel in Castle Sungrand, leading directly to the [[Dungeon of Castle Sungrand]]. 

Saint Windguard is the ancestor of [[Kalir Windguard]].
