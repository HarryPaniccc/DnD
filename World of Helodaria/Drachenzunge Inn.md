The **Drachenzunge (Dragon's Tongue) Inn** is a large comfortable inn a few miles west of [[Rokbaur Castle]] along the main road north out of [[Brocia]]. It has three floors for staying in, and a large communal meal room where food is served at specific times during the day.

It is run by a small family of Sirkonians.
