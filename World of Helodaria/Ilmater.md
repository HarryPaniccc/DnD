Ilmater is the deity of hardships, sacrifice, self improvement, and above all, strength. He is the sworn enemy of [[Asmodeus]], as the Ninth Imprisoned teaches that power can easily be attained. Ilmater teaches that through hardship, anything is possible. He is often worshipped by those who are sick or have endured hardship in their lives.
