Ilmater is the deity of hardships, sacrifice, self improvement, and above all, strength. He is the sworn enemy of [[Asmodeus]], as the Ninth Imprisoned teaches that power can easily be attained. Ilmater teaches that through hardship, anything is possible. He is often worshipped by those who are sick or have endured hardship in their lives.

>[!Tenets]
> - Any challenge, no matter how difficult or complex, can be completed through hardship and sacrifice. No matter what your flaws are, they can be overcome.
>- One can always grow and improve. Forget your achievements, there will always be someone whose own dwarf yours.
>- When one must choose between failure or self sacrifice, one must choose sacrifice, for while failure in its own is a form of improvement, the ability to sacrifice oneself for the greater good is the most valuable ability one can have.
