The Einzbern Hold is the base of the [[Einzberns]] in [[Keldmire|Keldmire]]. It was destroyed in the year 810 PF, preceding the enslavement of the Einzberns by [[Lucius]] and the [[Vorciln]].

# Repository
---
There is a massive repository of knowledge underneath the manor proper where, for centuries, the Einzberns have collected knowledge on the multiverse, specifically on monsters and monster hunting, alchemy, and profane magics.
## Alchemy Room
Think the alchemy room where they dissected the Lichen in the Witcher
## Transformation Room
Contains the profane, amorphous abomination swimming in the green soup. The creature once moved autonomously, without will but with energy. It now floats motionless, deceased.

### Right rooms towards alchemy

The hallway that stretches towards the right opens up into three distinct rooms.

- Medbay. This area has a cabinet of surgical instruments and a few medicines that have been spoiled. Some rotten herbs, a few mortars and pestles. The far left corner is caved in. A DC 15 investigation check/perception check reveals a pair of greater healing potions and an elixir of health in the rubble.
    
- Destroyed Reading room. This room has shattered desks and chairs
    
- Alchemy, Chemistry and Herbalism storage. This room has a half dozen rows of shelves that are sitting mostly empty. What does remain gives evidence that this was once a storage room for alchemical ingredients: jars of rotten eyeballs, chemical marks on the wood, dried out plants.
    

### Alchemy room

This room has a beveled in center, with an outer hallway that orbits the middle workshop. In the center, there is a table in the middle, upon which there is the torso of a goristro being dissected. Along the outer shelves, there is a beautiful vial that is able to be used as Oil of Sharpness twice.

### Front rooms at ground level

These rooms are designed to be small workspaces: general purpose nooks designed to be able to fit many different needs. Each has a central wooden table, a side desk that stretches a good distance, as well as a basin, a small shelf and a few chairs. There are 7 in total.

### Left rooms towards Arcanum and Study

- Workshop. This area contains a large amount of tinker’s supplies. There is a small forge, various acids for various chemical treating processes, braziers in the corners to provide light, as well as a large amount of 
    
- Training Arena. This open area serves no immediate purpose. On the floor in the center there is the school of the blades symbol, as well as at the entrances. The one in the center is stained slightly with blood, and there is damage to the area that gets less noticeable as you radiate outwards. On the far wall, there is a raised section behind a banister. There are bookshelves with techniques about how to master certain armed and unarmed artforms. One such Ruinan Elven style text is a Manual of Quickness of Action that specifically includes exercises for swordsmanship.
