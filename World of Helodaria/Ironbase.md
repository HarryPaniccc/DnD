Owned by the bugbear baron [[Rodan the Fair]], the ancient fortress of Ironbase has been reclaimed as a winterberry export hub. It is a small, young, but fast growing village of farmers and miners, situated near the [[Mungandr Lake]] in the [[Republic of Ruina]].
# Description
The village is built within the old walls of a great fortress that has fallen to ruin some time in the past. It is accessed by two roads, one leading north into the [[Shard Foothills]], and one leading east into [[Splitmount]].

The mountain to the south east of the village, a few hours away, is home to many old, yet still rich iron mines. One of these mines was occupied by a group of barbarian bandits that were defeated and cleared out by the [[Vanguard]].
