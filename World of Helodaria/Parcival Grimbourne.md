> A tall, muscular blue dragonborne with a towering, broad-shouldered frame. His posture is unnervingly upright. His head is crowned with backward-swept horn ridges. His snout is squared and sharp, filled with jagged teeth. 
> 
> He is wearing heavy, dark armour with jagged, storm-themed engravings. Scales are a cobalt blue with lighter electric-blue highlights, and his eyes glow faintly like lightning. Around his neck hangs a amulet carved from an ancient dragon’s tooth, shaped into a jagged thunderbolt wrapped by a claw (the holy symbol). It starts glowing faintly when he calls upon a storm. 
> 
> Also he carries a large, rune-marked war mace and a shield shaped like a broken dragon wing. His armour is a mix of knightly design and warped, chaotic elements—spikes, scorched edges, and flowing tattered cloth. It is like an overall look blends noble discipline with a dangerous presence. He also has, over his shoulders, a long (like up to his calves kind of), tattered cape of dark blue, edges like silver thread(shiny silver) like the shape of curling storm clouds or like clouds on the bottom edges.

Breath Weapon. You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest
