The **Imperial Annals** is a massive marble-pillared structure in the Silver-Strewn Quarter of [[Dularen]]. It is a massive library of information for the [[Imperial Arcanists]], as well as a meeting place for [[Arbiters]].

Histories, laws, transactions, deeds of ownership, paintings, memoirs and scrolls are all among the massive amount information stored in this multi-leveled building. When someone enters into the Annals who is not an [[Arbiters|Arbiter]] they must place their hand on a copper sphere with a [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] asking them their names and noting them down, as a method of deterring theft of important documents.
