Middle late age dwarf with brown hair and a slight dwarven accent. Dwarf Jarl Jaden Austring is a friend of Rodan's and will speak highly of him if the PCs ask. She is stout, has a light Dwarvish accent and is becoming lazy, moving all the main work of watching the town over to Adram, while she just collects taxes.
