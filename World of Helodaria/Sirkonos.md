**The Kingdom of Sirkonos** is an ancient Kingdom on the continent of [[Eranulaid]]. It is the west-most civilisation on the continent, and has historical roots in a pre-[[The Fall|Fall]] civilisation

Old woods, teeming with older magics and eldritch curses. Walled towns, owned by paranoid barons, constantly on guard from external threats. A central stone city cowering in the shadow of a dark manor, patrolled by a dreadful legion, subtly enforcing their master's will.

Sirkonos is a realm of uncertainty, made of swamps, wastelands, and wilderness, protected by guilds of monster hunters and the forces of local sheriffs. Criminal organisations orchestrate murders and thefts while lonely wizard towers shy away from the dangerous social-scape in order to study the innate darkness of the land.

# History
---
Before the apparent Sirkon royal lineage, the region where Sirkonos now sits as ruled by the [[Empire of Thay]].

# Geography
---
The kingdom is situated west of the [[Nightshade Peaks]]. The [[Maghlas Mountains]] have foothills that stretch down into the borders of the Sirkonos, and from the north to the south shore of the eastern third of the kingdom there stretches a vast region of wasteland and mire, the [[Eastern Wastes]]; a scar on the land left behind from [[The Fall]]. [[Banespear Mountain]] stands proudly at the south of the Wastes, [[Mount Ethris]] sits in the center of the built-up region of the land, and dark forests dot the landscape. #TODO 

### [[Aldwyn Highlands]]
- [[Port Eidenspear]]: The largest port town in the Kingdom, Eidenspear connects the people of Sirkonos to the rest of the world through trade, despite being somewhat isolated from other trade routes within the Kingdom
- **Villages** to be added

### [[Eastern Wastes]]
The large scar that stretches across the east third of the Kingdom and the greatest scar left on Eranulaid's land from the wars of [[The Fall]].

- [[Banespear Mountain]] is a vast, cursed peak that stands against the horizon like a split in a painting's canvass
- [[Fengate]] sits east of [[Banespear Mountain]]
- [[Kohldwall]] is a town that acts as a bastion within the Wastes. People usually use it as a point of refuge and trade from towns that are off its main path

### [[Miletohr Wilds]]
The large stretch of wilderness that curves below and into the foothills of the [[Maghlas Mountains]], the Miletohr wilds are a sometimes magical and often accursed wood.

- [[Leerehalt]]: The seat of Sirkonos' Royal family and the fortress where the [[Kronesguard]] are based and commanded from.
- [[Strahldale]]: An idyllic, calm farming village situated in the foothills of the [[Maghlas Mountains]] and overlooking the Wilds, the Wastes, and the Kingdom
- The [[Sieleran River]]: A mineral-rich river that flows through the northern wilds of Sirkonos, and cuts through [[Strahldale]] and eventually meets [[Brocia]].
- The [[Ethfalian Caverns]]: A large, mineral-rich network of caves that lead to the underdark and to [[Kenifria]]
- [[Ahnzlad Pass]] is a path that leads north of [[Brocia]]
- [[Steinjotunenwand]] or the Giant's Ward Fortress (Notes for this and Ahnzlad Pass are in Session 64)

### [[Maghlas Mountains]]

- [[Steinwalde]]: One of the two great dwarf fortresses of old to survive the wars of the Fall, Steinwalde, or “the stone forest”, is a massive walled retreat set deeply in the heart of the mountain range

### [[Broken Plains]]

- [[Mount Ethris]] is the mountain surrounded by Diredahl and the rest of the major cities
- [[Ralia]] is a town maybe akin to the Berserk 1997 opening town
- [[Brocia]]
- [[Keldmire]]. A beautiful walled city of paved roads, surrounded by orchids and farms

## Port Eidenspear

Port Eidenspear is the large port city on the southern shore of Sirkonos. It is the largest city in the kingdom other than Diredahl. Eidenspear is culturally the most vibrant city in Sirkonos, trade vessels from all around the world using it either as a refreshment port or trading with it directly.

  

The city is situated in a large bay that is itself set into the mainland and leads into a river, the shores of which are made of tall rocky mountains. The majority of the city situates itself between the base of these mountains and the shoreline.

    

## Ralia

## Brocia

The southern forests stretch sparsely into the city limits on the southern side. The structure is mostly well developed stonework on the interior, as the forest has dangers that people do not want to brave outside of the walls. 

  

The primary trade of the city is an influx of raw material from the wastes. It essentially operates as the main trade route between the capital and the resource rich wastes.

### Notable Locations

- Shöppe. Owned by Strudel and his with Merideth.
    
- Trading Market. A myriad of trades goods are sold around town, but they are mostly what 
    
- Central Rivers. Running through the village, entering from the top of the wall and splitting into multiple smaller streams, a beautiful, pure mineral water river runs through the town, originating from the 
    
- Smithy. Lunds smithy a weapons/armour shop. Lund had been well trained in her home city, but doesn't often get a chance to work with heavy materials to forge what she was taught to, so any opportunity she is glad to make something big. For a price.
    

### Notable Characters

- Shöppekeep Strudel. Elderly, not all there gnomish man. Manic in speech and not consistent speech patterns
    
- Blacksmith Lund. A young, slightly bearded female dwarf with her eyebrows incinerated off. Gentle in tone but strict on her business. Lund was born in Steinwald and made her way south to get away from her family. Lund knows about the Steinefni mining outpost that can be found at the source of the river, as the dwarves that pass through Strahldale for supplies have confided in her over time, or she pieced it together.
    
- Sheriff Thron. A rounder and heavier man than most, Thron is cold and focussed on his work, but kind to the children of Strahldale. He is bald and low eyed, and deep of voice. Thron is experienced in combat; in his youth he was part of an adventuring party who used to hunt lycans and other beasts of the sirkonian wastes for bounties.
