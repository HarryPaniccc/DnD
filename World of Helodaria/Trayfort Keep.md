Trayfort Keep is the home of the [[Vanguard]] located in the [[Ruina]], in the Outer-City Fields of [[Dularen]] some 4 hours south of the city.

# Characters

- [[Meeek]] - A white [[Kobold]] rescued by the Vanguard from the mountain above [[Vasspryg]]
- [[Skoldr Wittlewood]] - the Carpenter who Caede sought aid from in his personal projects and who he hired to fix the keep up a bit.
- [[Ulfric Straven]] - Ex [[Ashen Legion]] captain. He acts as the master of house and steward of the Vanguard. He keeps the wages in check in a well organized ledger. His wage is 180 gp per month.
### Other Staff

- 2 Cooks
- 5 Servants
- 

### Todo
Ulfric is looking for a small contingent of guards, 6 servants, and two cooks.

400 gp / month = 14 gp per day to spend
Guard wages are like what 6gp per month = 2 sp per day?, round up maybe to incentivise the first group making like 9gp per month = 3sp per day

A dozen guards = 108 gp per month for the unit
Servants get 2sp per day = 6gp per month
Cooks = 5sp per day = 15gp per month

Arming them with remainder of the month's finances

Liam's Numbers:
Guards = 1gp per day = 30gp per month per guard = 300gp per month (10 guards)
Cooks = 1gp per day = 30gp per month per cook = 60gp per month (2 cooks)
Servants = 5sp per day = 6gp per month per servant = 30gp per month (5 servants)

After talking
Guards = 15gp per month or 5sp per day
Cooks = 15gp per month or 5sp per day
Staff = 6gp per month or 2sp per day
