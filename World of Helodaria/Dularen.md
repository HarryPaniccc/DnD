# Description
The centre of the [[Republic of Ruina]], geologically and in terms of trade routes, the large, bustling city of Dularen is as varied as it is spacious. The streets of the city are worn, many traders pass through there on foot. Every major guild has footing in Dularen: the [[Ashen Legion]] holds a fortress for training, the [[Pantheons]] hold an entire districts for worship, and the [[Imperial Arcanists]] have a large records library within the centre of the city. Every trading guild works hard to keep their hold within Dularen.

The city is not only a centre for the wealthy but also a utopia for thieves. All kinds of shady businesses are run by the various gangs. On every street, a bar, every district a brothel, Dularen seeks to offer services for anyone and everyone. Even the [[Devil's Hand]] has a den hidden in the Warrens.
### Districts
The large city has to be divided into districts, otherwise there would be no order or getting around the place. The districts are as follows: the Warrens, upper and lower, the Silver-Sewn Quarter, the Outer-City fields, the Adulation District and the Blooming Run (or the Bloom for short).

The Outer-City fields is the name of the region south of the city. The richest of families and clans live in this farmland area, dotted with villas and fortresses and many of the more rich farms, such as grapevines and crops used in the liquor industry, as well as smaller food farms tended to by servants in order to keep the nobles independently fed. It is somewhat more dangerous to live outside of the city limits, however, and those who are unable to privately fund a defensive garrison usually are in danger of being robbed by highwaymen.

# Locations
## Outer-City Fields
### Locations
- [[Castle Gundrei]] is a large structure surrounded by a fortified wall that is well manned with the [[Gundrei Family]]'s personal guard. The path to the wall separates a vineyard and an orchard, facing towards the grounds has the orchard on oneâ€™s right.
## Silver-Strewn Quarter
The Silver-Sewn Quarter is a walled-off, central part of the City, and it is where the prominent nobles and richer houses live, other than those who choose to live outside in the Outer-City fields. The District is well guarded and gated off, with a garrison of guards dedicated entirely to the watching of its walls.

Notable interior features include well-kept gardens, rich houses and, interestingly, copper lines sewn into the well crafted streets, along which magically propelled trams glide silently through the district.
### Locations
- [[Castle Anavar]], home to [[House Vanariel]] 
- The [[Court of Verdicts]], a large stone pillared structure, made with sections of dark, strong oak and stone, acting as the primary meeting place for the [[Uldronos Council]].
- The Imperial Annals (I am going to regret this name), is a stark structure of marbled stone and various pillars. It contains an incredible collection of knowledge, and operates as both a library and a meeting place for the Imperial Arcanists.
## Adulation District
The Adulation District is the district devoted solely to worship of the Gods, their temples taking up a large portion of the space in this district. There are temples devoted to [[Tyr]], the [[Bahamut]], [[Corellon]] and [[Moradin]], but the largest structures in the area are the greater of the temples: The [[Grave Nest]], the [[Dularen Heart-Kiln]], and the [[Spire of Radiance]]. Being an area of great holy value, there are [[Lawbearers]] that patrol the streets, vigilantly ensuring that the peace of worship is undisturbed.
### Locations
- The [[Grave Nest]] is both a graveyard and a place of worship to the followers of the Raven Queen. The area is approximately 75 hectares surrounded by well kept metal and stone fences and gates, the main gate about double the size of the smaller ones. There are a total of 5 temple-structures within the Nest, the largest of which acting as a central worshiping location. The location is dotted with trees and a great variance in grave sizes and level of affluence. There are stone benches, small shrines and pathways throughout the entire area.
- The [[Spire of Radiance]] is an incredibly tall, prism-like structure that is a temple dedicated to [[Lathander]], the Lord of Radiance. Its height penetrates the skyline of Dularen, easily being the tallest structure in the city. Its base is a sturdy, light grey stone structure with stained glass windows of light, warm colours.
- The Great [[Dularen Heart-Kiln]] is a wide based structure with banners depicting Moradin flowing around it in the wind. Decorated with elements of deep red and gold. There is a mighty forge at the center of this temple in the lower levels, but it pales in comparison to its sister in Mountreach. Nevertheless weapons and armour adorn the walls, as well as the great anvil in the center of the communal room being used to forge weapons and crafts ceremoniously. It is a spiritual place of dwarvish and communal strength. One of three Heart-Kilns in Ruina.

## Blooming Run
The Blooming Run takes up the most amount of space of the districts. It houses the center of trade, the majority of the guard force of the city, and many of the lower-middle to high-middle class citizens of Dularen. Much of the trade that passes through Dularen is done in this district, specifically in the Peddle.
### Locations
**The Peddle** is a permanent, large-scale marketplace on the northern side of the Bloom. Here, one can find pretty much anything that can be sold legally (and sometimes, the other stuff too). Locations in the Peddle include:
- [[Gilded Resolution]]
- **Smithy** owned by Human smith [[Gilda]]. Nothing magical or spectacular, the cross-shaped building is at the centre of a crossroads, where its four forge rooms are working throughout the day to provide much of the district with metalwork.
- **The Vorpal Keep** is located on the southern end of the northern Warrens. It is a roughly 60m diameter fortress which houses the barracks and command keep for the Ashen legion in the area. Notably
- **Halo of Chains Rendezvous Town House**. A plot of land legally owned by **Elena Marcurio**, a pseudonym for [[Syndra]], using a large amount of hereditary wealth to purchase the property. It overlooks much of the Silver Strewn quarter as well as the adulation district while still being a great ways out of the way. It is built near a market of sorts and can house roughly 15 people comfortably.

Outside of the Peddle is a simple, well kept cityscape with many places to dine, drink and live out your life.
- The **Dripping Barrel inn** (6Sp/Night) is a hearty, large inn with the first floor being a tavern. In the far right there is a bar on a raised half of the floor, and the far left there is a staircase leading above the bar to the open top floor with 8 total rooms, 4 on either side. There is also a stable that is available for 7cp per day, per animal. The place is run by a collection of waiter staff and [[Albanny Halonoth]].
	- Bonnard is a fairly stout, short haired human barhand who works at the dripping barrel.
- The **Laughing Deck** is a tavern run by halfling man [[Dick Pemberton]], the establishment contains a collection of tables.
- **The Hold** is a small castle-like structure in which the [[Ashen Legion]] keeps its warriors, and generals should they visit town.
## The Warrens
The Warrens is a district that stretches from the northwest down to the southern entrance of the city.
- The **Dead Beat** is a small bar owned by human man Giligan Eiselcrest and often run by dwarf man Reben. The place is a front to a fighting ring where Giligan runs many kinds of shows. Inside is a small bar but a door to the back room leads down a very long flight of stairs, maybe 20m underground, to the main event room, a fighting pit surrounded by tables that is lowered to the ground about 1m. There is a substantially larger bar in the corner and many people come down here for the spectacle of the undead battles. The events include brawls and battles against undead. Monetary rules are simple, enter and win: and you double your money, but the minimum is agreed by all parties involved. No spells, magic items are allowed but Gilligan doesn't want everyone to be buried in many tons of street. He has the Minotaur Hesmas as the main muscle of the establishment, but there are two ogre zombies, one with a maul the other holding a cannon.
