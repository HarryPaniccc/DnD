The Kingdom of Sirkonos is an ancient Kingdom on the continent of [[Eranulaid]]. It is the west-most civilisation on the continent, and has historical roots in a pre-[[The Fall|Fall]] civilisation

Old woods, teeming with older magics and eldritch curses. Walled towns, owned by paranoid barons, constantly on guard from external threats. A central stone city cowering in the shadow of a dark manor, patrolled by a dreadful legion, subtly enforcing their master's will.

Sirkonos is a realm of uncertainty, made of swamps, wastelands, and wilderness, protected by guilds of monster hunters and the forces of local sheriffs. Criminal organisations orchestrate murders and thefts while lonely wizard towers shy away from the dangerous socialscape in order to study the innate darkness of the land. ==The royal family has seeming all but forgotten about the rest of the country, all the while, the powerful vampires of Clan [[Vorciln]] are exerting their influence on those around them from their dark castle gateway to the outer planes.== #TODO Edit the royal family bit

# Geography
The Kingdom is situated on the Western Shores of the northmost continent of [[Helodaria]], [[Eranulaid]]. The [[Maghlas Mountains]] have foothills that stretch down into the borders of the kingdom. From the north to the south shore of the eastern third of the kingdom there stretches a vast region of wasteland and mire, the [[Eastern Wastes]]. a scar on the land left behind from [[The Fall]]. [[Banespear Mountain]] stands proudly at the south of the Wastes, [[Mount Ethris]] sits in the center of the built-up region of the land, and dark forests dot the landscape. #TODO 
### [[Aldwyn Highlands]]

- [[Banespear Mountain]] is a vast, cursed peak that stands against the horizon like a split in a painting's canvass

### [[Miletohr Wilds]]
The large stretch of wilderness that curves below and into the foothills of the [[Maghlas Mountains]], the Miletohr wilds are a sometimes magical and often accursed wood.

### [[Broken Plains]]
- [[Mount Ethris]] is the mountain surrounded by Diredahl and the rest of the major cities

# Society and Factions
## Politics
### The Crown
The Sirkonian royal line is represented by deep purples and blues, rules from castle [[Leerehalt]], and bares the symbol of two dragons facing apart from one another with their mouths open. The royal lineage has their founding in the fall, where [[King Sirkon]] the first defended the ancient city of [[Diredahl]] from the hordes of [[Malar]] from the position of [[Don Murroc]], the Great Spire of the West.
## Military
[[Kronesguard]] and its armies
## Religion
[[Ilmater]] and [[Lathander]] are worshipped a lot

#TODO 
## Port Eidenspear

Port Eidenspear is the large port city on the southern shore of Sirkonos. It is the largest city in the kingdom other than Diredahl. Eidenspear is culturally the most vibrant city in Sirkonos, trade vessels from all around the world using it either as a refreshment port or trading with it directly.

  

The city is situated in a large bay that is itself set into the mainland and leads into a river, the shores of which are made of tall rocky mountains. The majority of the city situates itself between the base of these mountains and the shoreline.

## Fengate

The small mire-town of Fengate is located at the base of Banespear Mountain. The gentle swamps made for comfortable living conditions for a small group of farmers, but it only saw growth after a vein of tin and silver was found around 730 PF. Since then the village has seen a strong mining export.

  

The surrounding mire is mostly only travelable on the main roads with any form of efficiency, and a small forest surrounds the village. 

### Notable Locations

- The Western Watchtower is an old ruin that has been repurposed as a guard outpost within the forest to the north-west of the village. It provides a little bit of safety to travellers caught in the mire-woods after dark. Some of the sheriff’s men are always posted there.
    

- The Marketplace takes up the majority of the main road that connects the two entrances to the city. The majority of things that can be bought there. The muddy road is populated by stalls of fresh fruit and beer stalls and other commodities.
    

- The beer stall is run by a particularly stout dwarf with no hair and bushy eyebrows
    
- The butcher’s stall is run by an overweight human male of darker skin.
    
- The silverworker’s stall is run by a human woman of red hair and slight frame.
    
- There is a large General Trade stall run by a short haired tiefling man with strong red skin.
    

- The Spearpommel Inn is a small wooden structure a short distance into the main road. Small tavern and a bar, upstairs that boasts 4 rooms of moderate size. Run by Dunmer Eiseltan.
    

  

### Notable People

- Sheriff Burgon Ironclad. Dark brown furred Bugbear. He leads a small militia and takes taxes on the area. His men guard the walls of Fengate from attack. He has a great axe and chainmail. Gritty slight german accent.
    
- Dunmer Eiseltan Innkeep of the Spearpommel Inn. Rouner, Short dark hair. Higher Sirkonian accent
    
- Adelaide. Her mother owns a fruit stand. Red hair and a button nose and green eyes
    

## Ralia

## Brocia

The southern forests stretch sparsely into the city limits on the southern side. The structure is mostly well developed stonework on the interior, as the forest has dangers that people do not want to brave outside of the walls. 

  

The primary trade of the city is an influx of raw material from the wastes. It essentially operates as the main trade route between the capital and the resource rich wastes.

### Notable Locations

- Shöppe. Owned by Strudel and his with Merideth.
    
- Trading Market. A myriad of trades goods are sold around town, but they are mostly what 
    
- Central Rivers. Running through the village, entering from the top of the wall and splitting into multiple smaller streams, a beautiful, pure mineral water river runs through the town, originating from the 
    
- Smithy. Lunds smithy a weapons/armour shop. Lund had been well trained in her home city, but doesn't often get a chance to work with heavy materials to forge what she was taught to, so any opportunity she is glad to make something big. For a price.
    

### Notable Characters

- Shöppekeep Strudel. Elderly, not all there gnomish man. Manic in speech and not consistent speech patterns
    
- Blacksmith Lund. A young, slightly bearded female dwarf with her eyebrows incinerated off. Gentle in tone but strict on her business. Lund was born in Steinwald and made her way south to get away from her family. Lund knows about the Steinefni mining outpost that can be found at the source of the river, as the dwarves that pass through Strahldale for supplies have confided in her over time, or she pieced it together.
    
- Sheriff Thron. A rounder and heavier man than most, Thron is cold and focussed on his work, but kind to the children of Strahldale. He is bald and low eyed, and deep of voice. Thron is experienced in combat; in his youth he was part of an adventuring party who used to hunt lycans and other beasts of the sirkonian wastes for bounties.
