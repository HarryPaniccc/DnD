# Description
**Castle Sungrand** is a fortress in the valley near [[Nethendell]] in the north of [[Zitrumea]]. The fortress itself is tiered: The outer wall being a newer, erected wooden wall surrounded by a 15ft. wide marshy moat, accessible by wooden pathways that can be easily collapsed, and watched by wooden archer towers.

Inside the outer wall is a collection of newer houses for farmers and tents for refugees. Within the inner wall is the older, more permanent structure, the same form as the **Keep on the Borderlands**. The raised hill section is surrounded by the older town, and a gate exists on the pathway towards it.

# Locations
### Inner Keep
- **Meeting Chamber**. The dark, spacious, stone room where [[Lord Margit Tormon]] holds his councils and assemblies. The chamber is supported by four thick pillars and exists after an antechamber into the keep itself. The ceiling is around 10ft tall so the room does not sacrifice efficiency for grandiosity.
### Central Wall
- **Smithy and Armorer** - At the entrance to the keep sits a two storied structure with a forge at the bottom that is backed up with repairing weapons. Master smith **half orc** [[Melgron the Smith]] has taken on half a dozen apprentices along with his usual labourers to make up for the additional work. 
	  *Services*: Not much magical work can be done, but they have seen a few in their day. Masterworked weapons can be repaired or appraised.
- **[[Borderlands Inn]]** - A three-storied structure overlooking the well in the square of the keep. The bottom is a large tavern, once filled with travellers through the region, now occupied mostly by soldiers bearing Tormon colours. Run by [[Esme Stumpstride]].
- **Chapel** - Dungeon undeneath
- **Provisions Merchant**  - Near the entrance to the courtyard outside of the castle, the provisions merchant's offices sit. [[Emile Greenhill]] has his fair share of goods for sale. He pays some of the people of the town to go corpse picking to find things for his profits. He has two bodyguards, a [[Human Brawler]] and a [[Human Knave]] from **Flee, Mortals!**, each with a [[Potion of Hill Giant Strength]] (STR = 21 for an hour)
