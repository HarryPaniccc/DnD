**Marthirion** was an ancient wizard who was determined to discover how to forcefully create sorcerers during the [[Old Ruinan Empire]]. He was the headminister of the [[Synod of Elevation]]. In his final years, he discovered a page from the [[Book of Vile Darkness]] and its study consumed him, but allowed him to live on, partially, as a Mummy Lord.
