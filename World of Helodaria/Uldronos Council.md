## The Uldronos Council

Upon the founding of the Empire, the government was in need of Rulers. The young empire was in need of rulers, and the noble houses who came from other lands due to opportunity, and who ruled over their own militia were the obvious choices to lead the people of the newly formed Ruina.

  

For a few years, a patchwork government protected trade routes and mostly kept the peace. After some time, a council of 14 members was elected based on an equal representation-population ratio, in which the amount of members from a race seated in the council would be a fraction of the council that is equal to the fraction of the population that represents that race. The council seats were hereditary, and in case an heir would not be found, the next of kin within the noble house would take the seat upon their death.

  

Over time, the council adapted its membership, and adopted a few new seats as larger factions grew to power. The non hereditary seats include the Arch Mage of the Imperial Arcanists and the High Paladin of Tyr.

  

Certain seats of the council are given duties that their families naturally evolved to have a hold over. While officially, all members hold the same power, those who are good at their jobs usually see to it as the unofficial authority of the matter.

  

The members on the Uldronos Council are:

    
-   
    

## Families of Ruina

- The Gravis family is known for their estate of wine found in splitmount. Lord Enthale currently sits in an uldronos council seat.
    
- [The Ironstones](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13w5_6RgL7_Y474WnyhimVfk5VPi0UiRvcO4kg4IrFAk/edit#bookmark=id.h3wl60g57m3i) are a rich dwarf family with ownership of the mithril mine and Ironstone Cellars, along with the refinery responsible for casting the mithril. They are situated in the Wyrm hole.
    
- The Brimheart family is a human bloodline that has been around since the founding of Ruina, originally hailing from central Eranulaid. Only in the latest 2 generations have they gained an extraordinary amount of affluence and power outside of the Ruinan council. Their family court is situated overlooking the [Amberloch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13w5_6RgL7_Y474WnyhimVfk5VPi0UiRvcO4kg4IrFAk/edit#bookmark=id.3xhsubxurv3t), and it is here that the last of their true bloodline and his wife plot to grow their family's power. Currently they are involved with Devils, using a mutual deal to gain power.
    

- Sylas Brimheart is Ulysses’ father. Deceased.
    
- Earl Ulysses Brimheart is the last son of the Brimheart lineage. A well groomed man with a sharp goatee and fine, almost militaristic clothes. He has dark brown eyes, and his hair is long and kept back.
    
- General Nalamor, Pit Fiend. A renowned and respected general of the Nine Hells, Nalamor has taken it upon himself to deal with Ulysses Brimheart, as the noble’s tenacity and cunning has proven that it requires direct influence. Nalamor is cruel and cunning.
    

  

## The Guard

It is run in part by the high priest of Tyr, if there is one, and in part by the Uldronos Council

  

Ranks in the guard:

1. High Paladin of Tyr
    
2. Law-bearers (think LB but also act as guards for the High Temple of the Pantheon, answer directly to the high paladin alone, heavy armour and high quality axes, plate armour, called in in order to enact the will of the law or the will of Tyr, they are the greatest protectors of Ruina, other than the PC's of course, they go after heretics, traitors and breakers of higher laws)
    
3. Guard Steward (oversees the entire guard in a single settlement, guard captains report to them and they report to the council and/or high paladin of Tyr if they are told to, they do not report directly to Law-bearers, but must do as they say, as the LBs are commanded by the high paladin directly)
    
4. Guard Captain (oversees a regiment of guards, around 7 or 8, and leads them, in larger cities they control the "precincts")
    
5. Guard
    

  

The Guard usually maintains order in accordance to the laws of the empire. They can be lazy, and are less capable than they put on. They form the official military of Ruina.

  

Guards are usually outfitted with well made leather armour, a spear and a shield, but the more advanced and higher stationed guards use glaives and sturdier armour. They can also wield longswords and crossbows/bows.

  

## The Ashen Legion

## The Devil’s Hand

Based primarily in the Wyrm Hole, the Devil’s Hand is the nickname of the leader of the criminal organisation identified unofficially by the same name. The group is one of the least moral of the criminal organisations in the Empire. This is understandable, the Devil’s Hand is is an oni in disguise. They trade in drugs, illegal weapons, beasts, slaves, artifacts, and just about anything that pays.They can be hired for anything, and even though they have no limitations, or at least the Hand doesnt,they still are able to complete work with subtlety. The Cassanders didnt touch this shit with a 10 foot pole.

  

### Characters

- The Hand. Oni Male in the form of a nimble beast of man.  Very few know of his actual form. He is groomed, with a tight beard and a falsely kind face, with a bald head.. His eyes are pale green. His left hand is a porcelain prosthetic from just above the elbow down. He wears warm fur clothes and lives a life of control and domination. His personality is controlling, sadistic and lacking empathy. He will do what he must to further his agenda. He sounds like Bane but less bane.
    
- Dafran Daugus. Human that looks and sounds like Keanu Reeves. He wears a leather jacket over a breastplate when not working. While actively on the job he wears splint armour with somewhat tight chain sleeves and a quality leather mask. Relative to the other contractors that work for the Devil’s Hand, he is professionally groomed and presents himself well. He wields a magical curved longsword on his back. He is untrusting of anyone and is a brutal warrior.
    
- Selena Miyana. Grey tiefling woman who acts as the Hand’s magical reference. She is an illusion mage and knows the Hand’s true nature, and such has a fear for him that she hides extensively. She has small horns that barely peek through her bob hair. Her eyes are blood red. She sounds like Asami from the legend of Korra
    
-   
    

## High Temple of the Pantheons

Worship Bahumat, Tyr and Lathander as their primary trio of gods within the Empire of Ruina. 

### Characters

## Imperial Arcanists

With the empire of Ruina being so magically inclined, the government would need some intermediary to interact with the magical world so the Arcanists were formed. The largely imperial group is dedicated to all super magical occurrences in Ruina, and with researching and safeguarding magic for the Empire, along with developing magics that can be used by the Empire. The create magical items, oversee the teaching of magic by the scholarship and by others, safeguard powerful artifacts and tomes, and keep a watch on any unique individuals. The also play a small part in the guard force, as their Sentinels are a sort of magical guard, but are more scarce and are usually restricted to larger cities. They are a sort of magical policing force, operating where the guard would likely be too brutish, where a scalpel is needed, not a hammer.

  

They have collected many artifacts over the years, and have forged alliances with mythical beasts. The most notable of these are the Flame of Reality and the Magi Talismans. The flame is being protected on the top levels of the Ixalan Complex and the Talismans are guarded by 2 individuals, half of them are with the grandmage of the Arcanists, and the other half are in the possession of the Ancient Silver Dragon Harix, who lives at the top of the complex.

  

Generally, everyone involved with the Arcanists wields the following: 

- cloak of protection, around their hip
    
- Winged boots
    
- Uniform robes
    

  

### The Sentinels

Are the “military” of the arcanists. A small group of wizards devout to the empire, but too valuable to be wasted in the ranks of the guard. They are a sect of skilled enforcers loyal primarily to Lord Newbide, but also in part to Gwendolyn Yuri. All are trained in unarmed combat and the use of magic. Some are sorcerers, others practised wizards and all are given the freedom to distribute their training hours in whatever ratio that they see fit.

  

They wear coats

- Lina Sweetsong. Rylei Sweetsongs estranged sister. She has deep brown eyes and short brown hair. The halfling woman is a skilled bladesinger, and completely and implicitly loyal to Darius Newbide.
    

### Key Players

- Grandmaster Gwendelyn “Lyn” Yuri. Red haired younger version of Suyin beifong. She acts wiser than she looks, around 38 years old, and commands immense magical power. She is widely regarded as possibly the most powerful magic user in all of Ruina. She came into her position as arch mage of the arcanists in the year 803 PF at the age of 29, the youngest of all arch mages before her by at least a decade.
    

  

On her right arm, she is decorated with four of the eight Magi Talismans: the charms of Evocation, Conjuration, Abjuration and Enchantment, giving her the given boosts associated with those items. As well as the Talismans, the other magical items she bears are: a boosted charm of protection (operates as a +2 ring of protection, worn on her hip), a Robe of Archmagi (used sparingly as a belt), and Winged Boots.

- High Arbiter Gideon Quandary.
    
- Master Harix, the Adult Silver Dragon. Born around 300 years prior, he acted as one of the primary guides to Founder Ixalan when he founded the arcanists.
    
- Ixalan, the great founder. One of the grandmages of past, he built the Ixalan complex when he came into possession of the flame of reality. The complex housed his friend Harix the silver dragon and the flame. Harix would be tasked with protecting the flame until death.
    
- Arbiter Aramis Terelon. A High Elf man of just below collar bone length blond hair with darker ends and beautiful green eyes. He wears dark aquamarine and black robes with light pauldron shoulder pads and silver inlay. He is firm in tone and intelligent.

## Barony Mercenaries

A small group of mercenaries from the southern baronies that have come for the bounty from the empire for the undead of the Wyrm Hole.

- Bjorn. Human fighter male. The more intelligent and better talker of the group, Bjorn has yellow braided hair and a beard, with woven leather breastplate and leather bracers connected by clothes. Quality boots. He carries a pair of handaxes as his sides, and wears a bearskin cloak with a square buckle on his left shoulder made of gold worth 100Gp. Exceptionally made. Sounds like Bjurn and Ragnar together.
    
- Caldur. Half orc barbarian. A controlled fighter barbarian, using a combination of skill and natural strength as his main weapons in combat. He wields a pair of scimitars taken from merchants. Sounds like rattlesnake jake but scottish-er.

- Drand. Dwarf bard. He wears heavy furs and a longsword alongside his horn. A strong fighter aside from his magical capabilities, but he acts as the educated mage of the group. Sounds like Rolo I guess.
    

  

## Dragons of Eranulaid

- Zakuul, the Chained One, Ageing adult blue dragon. Zakuul was imprisoned as a very young dragon, Zakuul was sold to Drow as a slave, where he was used as brute labour, experimented on, harvested for his natural magical power and passed around from duergar to drow and back, enslaved for over 400 years. He is quick to temper, and his only goal is to free himself and grow in power to wreak vengeance upon his captors. He is a powerful ageing blue dragon. Zakuul was born above ground and lived near the Seidr Plateau for around 20 years before he was captured. He is the blue dragon that the unnamed mercs captured in their oneshot.
    
- Roshuldra, the Ivy Horror, Adult Green Dragon, is located in a forest in the Seidr Plateau known as the Mistwood. She made her lair near a source of shadowfell energy which she studied to improve her necromancy magic. Her lair sits behind a waterfall.
    

## The Valkuur

The Valkuur were a collection of Planetaar that were devoted to a pantheon of lesser deities and led by the Lord of the Hanged early in the Age of Ascension. These Lesser Deities were agents of the Greater Pantheon in Eranulaid. They were sent as warriors during the great Magi War that sundered the continent. The Valkuur were as follows:

- Caede Ingen Navn 
    
- Galund
    

## The Halo of Chains

Caede was not the only angel of the previous age to survive through the destruction caused by the book of souls. Having lived past millenia and being resurrected with part of his memory, a second planetar arose with not only a resentment for the previous gods, but a mission all his own. Collecting a cult of like minded individuals, those who are resentful to the gods. EDIT THIS

They have a [safehouse](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13w5_6RgL7_Y474WnyhimVfk5VPi0UiRvcO4kg4IrFAk/edit#bookmark=id.hxxfdefguf9n) in the northern part of the Dularen Warrens.

## Followers of Thezuurol (unnamed group)

A powerful Glabrezu demon has found its way into the prime material plane and has amassed a hold over a small, strategically membered cult, primary goal of growing through political power, as well as draining those around it of any kind of strength.

  

Actively .

- Thezuurol is a vicious glabrezu demon that was summoned to the material plane by the [Halo of Chains](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rH96ykh0O_k31cQYo7ODkRSDxPKFuzsTjmPG9BHoNhA/edit#bookmark=id.yvyfkeue3agn) in exchange for information on the whereabouts of the Tomb of Lathander in Ironspine Pass (Session 26-28ish). The leader of the group, it often takes up the form of Tara (ta-ruh) using its polymorph ability, acting as really the only political and intelligent influence for the group. Tara is a coy, manipulative dark haired woman who wears loose silks of black and red. Although Tara is a useful tool to get close to those with the power that Thezuurol wishes to manipulate, she is often only used to secure the initial hold of control, Thezuurol then controlling from afar. Tara sounds like vex.
    
- Garen is a half orc half tiefling who had little to no purpose in life until Thezuurol. Then, after they were summoned, Thezuurol saw an opportunity to manipulate a powerful frontal lackey who could be used to do their dirty work. Garen is a powerful, brutish warlock who often uses mask of many faces to hide his abyssal nature in the form of a simple, average build half-orc. In reality, his true visage is that of an eight-foot tall tannaruk beast of a man who wields fiendish warlock magic and devastating natural strength in combat. Ultimately, however, he is a disposable asset to Thezuurol. He has a somewhat british accent with a deeper voice.
    

### Goals

  

## The Knights of Malevolence

The 5 generals of the malevolence's army, not to be confused with the three generals of the malevolence. They supervised the great draconic armies of the malevolence, keeping dragons in check and leading great sieges and crushing resistances at the time.

## The Trading Guilds

The platinum scale, a guild that operates across the whole of the platinum high road

Raised in Dularen and joined and left the guard, he sought to see the empire, so he signed up as a bodyguard and works with the Platinum Scale trading company. His fur is a dark brown with black highlights. Very jas ou. Friendly to travelers. He sounds like Grog with the jaw thing
    
- Percy. Human tradesman. Literally just percy from Vox Mach
    

  

Sirkonos Factions

## The Einzbern family

Once a creed of paladins during the Age of Ascension, the Einzberns are now a family of Sirkonian monster hunters. They were enslaved by Clan Vorciln and used as a private army before Kanan made his escape. They were subsequently hunted down by Vorcilns knights led by their new enforcer.

  

During the Age of Ascension, the Einzberns were a sect of paladins of lathander that were known by a different name lost to time. During this age, a powerful necromancer by the name of Athelstan fell to vampirism and, in his new undead form, driven by a lust for understanding, grew his knowledge and eventually grew a large following of people looking to grow their understanding of blood magic.

  

The Paladins of Lathander eventually grew to understand the danger of this cult,

## The Vampires of clan Vorciln

The vampires of clan Vorciln worship Athelstan the Blood Fey. They are unlike other vampires, using more traditional magics and sorceries than the powers of darkness. They don’t use hemomancy, just blood themed spells. Savathuun granted them this form of vampirism and was then banished to the blood drain. 

  

They exist as a large influence in Sirkonos. They are powerful beings with large control. They are feared by nobles and peasants alike. If they want something it is often foolish to deny them. They are not unreasonable, and will not kill at random, but they are incredibly dangerous.

  

Their ranks of soldiers are 3 fold. Their aptitude for necromancy allows them to command a large force of undead, engineered for specific tasks. Tanks, soldiers, beasts. Any shape or form needed is available to them. The horrors under their control are as varied as they are powerful. Their thralls are notable, often only specific individuals are enthralled due to their danger or power. Their most dangerous and primary force are the Knights of Vorciln. A group of paladins who pledged themselves to destroying the clan, they were defeated and rendered half undead by the clan, and are now entirely under their control. No one knows exactly how many of them there are, and if they are killed, they usually do not stay down for long. 

  

The final of these forces were the Einsberns, not enthralled and not undead, merely enslaved due to the nature of their abilities and bloodline. The night that Kanan and his brother attempted escape, small sects of Einsberns were formed and subsequently hunted down by the knights of Vorclin, lead by their new enforcer, Kanan's brother Tevis Einsbern, whose curse was deepened by further rituals.

  

They have 2 goals, increase their control and return Athelstan to the material plane. They have ways of communicating with the blood lord but cannot bring his body into the real world. One of the ways that they planned to do so was to take 2 of the bloodline that sealed him away and create a new seal inside of their bodies, uniting them as a sort of vessel where Athelstan will be able to control, effectively combining the two into a suit in which Athelstan will live. The ritual is what gave Kanan Einzbern and his brother their abilities. Their powers are due to their connection with the blood lord, and now a piece of him lives in both of them, eternally bound to their souls.

  

The vamps live in a great fortress that can go in and out of the Shadowfell at any time

  

Vampires and other main characters

- Athelstan, the blood fey. Sealed away during the Ascension, Athelstan is a fey of incredible dark magic, possessing the Vampyric Curse. The Einzbern paladin creed of old took a seal that would persist within their bloodline, ensuring so long as their descendants survived, Athelstan could never return. Now, a ritual has caused Kanan and Tevis Einzbern to be a sort of channel of his power in the material plane. Sounds like Artagan from critical role. He was sealed using the power of the Vessel of Avarice, a powerful, dark artefact in the shape of a chalice that has the ability to syphon power into a ritual through sacrifice.  
      
    He wields the vampiric curse, but due to his magic, he is not harmed by the sun, merely weakened by it. He was not able to be defeated, so the Einzberns decided to forge a prison in the place where he can be held forever, where the sun never fully sets.
    
- Elandra Seinorin, Duchess of clan Vorciln, Cleric Blood Domain. A pure vampiric half-drow seductress with great control over the arcane arts. Dresses in revealing leather with tight gloves and fetishized boots and a collar that protrudes about 10cm above her shoulders and a butt cape that descends to around her knees. She has long black hair and elegant features. Her eyes are the same bright crimson as the rest of the clan. Although she holds allegiance to the clan, she is far less objective in her methods. Oftentimes she will act out of impulse and desire rather than bettering the clan’s objectives. These impulses will never be against the clan’s goals, however. She sounds like Syndra but more lustrous.
    
- Christoph Deired, Duke of clan Vorkiln, Eldritch Knight Fighter. A duelist and strategist, Christoph, alongside the Knights of Vorciln’s General, have led the inquisition on Western Sirkonos. He wields a rapier and wears light half plate armour. He has neat hair and a well kept full beard, both of orange hue, and bright crimson eyes. He is Sirkonian Obi-Wan.
    
- Lucius Vorcile. An academic at heart, Lucius is the reason that the Vorciln were formed. In his youth, over 500 years ago, he became obsessed with the dark powers in the history of his home empire of Ruina, before the Uldronos Council. He turned to vampirism to save himself from a sickness, and in doing so, his obsession with power grew. His experiments would too.
    

  
During his life, he was confronted by the Einzberns who were more warriors than blood hunters at that point.
