Of the [[Great Houses]], [[House Ralenroth]] is one of the most devoted to their lands. Living in the north of [[Zitrumea]], the house has a very close history with the elven lords of [[Qel-Annura]].
This kinda makes sense.
# Description
The head of house Ralenroth is King of the northern lands.
# History
During the wars of [[The Fall]], house Ralenroth allied themselves with [[Sehanine]] worshippers of [[Qel-Annura]] to do battle with the enemies of mankind near the north of Zitrumea. They did know of the hidden location of the [[Mirror of Liraleth]], but aided in hiding it after the end of the conflict.
