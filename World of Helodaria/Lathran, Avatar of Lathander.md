Lathran is one of the three god kings of the [[Desseran Apostolate]]. He appears as a handsome, young human man with sun-tanned skin and golden hair, with eyes of gold flecked with amber.

After the death of his siblings during [[The Fall]], Lathran spent a millenia running, trying to deal with his nature, unable to govern. He spent all his time and power hiding, locking himself away and wandering [[Eranulaid]], until he sensed a change in the winds. He fled to [[Steinwalde]] circa 650 PF, and has remained there, in the greatest stronghold available to him, ever since.
