The Wooden Fang is a magical item shop in [[Diredahl]] run by [[Woed]] the Blue Dragonborn sorcerer, and the family of Kobolds that live in his attic. The space is made up of a stone floor with a highly varied selection of wooden cabinets and tables displaying various magical items. Opposite the entrance is the counter where Woed does his trades, to the left is a store for various potions, and to the right is a sitting room. Overhead an iron chandelier floats gently, giving off an electric yellow glow to the main room. A staircase spirals up and behind the counter to [[Woed]]'s living space.
