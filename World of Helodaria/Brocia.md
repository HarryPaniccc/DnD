# Description
Brocia is a low lying city near to where the bogs of the [[Eastern Wastes]] start becoming challenging to navigate. It is known as the "last refuge" for travellers looking to travel into the wastes towards [[Kohldwall]] or to another destination. Many minerals and materials from the various small villages in the wastes filter through the city and head towards the more prominent trading lanes of the [[Kingdom of Sirkonos]], and so there is a large presence of traders, adventurers, and monster hunters looking to provide their services.

The town is situated within a water basin with fresh water that flows from the [[Ethfalian Caverns]] and [[Strahldale]], and various canals stretch through the city, with many bridges making up the roads that are raised one level above the water level.

Brocia is situated north of the forest of ==INSERT==.
