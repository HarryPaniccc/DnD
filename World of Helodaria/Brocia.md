# Description
Brocia is a low lying city near to where the bogs of the [[Eastern Wastes]] start becoming challenging to navigate. It is known as the "last refuge" for travelers looking to travel into the wastes towards [[Kohldwall]] or to another destination. Many minerals and materials from the various small villages in the wastes filter through the city and head towards the more prominent trading lanes of the [[Sirkonos]], and so there is a large presence of traders, adventurers, and monster hunters looking to provide their services.

The town is situated within a water basin with fresh water that flows from the [[Ethfalian Caverns]] and [[Strahldale]], and various canals stretch through the city, with many bridges making up the roads that are raised one level above the water level.

Brocia is situated north of the [[Unnamed Forest South of Brocia]].
