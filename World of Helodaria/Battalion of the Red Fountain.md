Also known as the **Order of the Red Fountain** or the **Garrison of Diredahl**, the army that defends [[Diredahl]] is one of the [[Kronesguard]]'s most prestigious and largest forces. They are easily identified by their stark crimson cloaks worn by their officers.

The battalion acquired their name and signiature cloaks from the story of their founding. It is said that in the defence of [[Diredahl]] during [[The Fall]], the soldiers bathed the streets in the blood of the hordes that besieged the city, to the point that the waters of the cisterns were soaked red, and the fountains of **Fountainhead Plaza** turned crimson. The soldiers were said to have died their cloaks in the blood of the fallen enemies and allies, and the battalion of the red fountain earned their name.
