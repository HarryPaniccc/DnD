# Description
Situated in the north of the [[Dularen Plains]]. A town in [[Ruina]].

A working town, malibrook uses the high quality, volcanically enriched wood to manufacture barrels, carts and boats, as well as exporting timber to the super wealthy who want to build high quality housing for themselves. The citizens are mostly middle or lower class workers.

A water elevator in an artificial dam exists as the town’s central feature. The dam can be closed and filled to raise a boat higher so that timber doesn’t need to be lifted around the entire town.

A few old ruins around the village are used as bastions for the Ashen Legion. They want to be able to control the barrier to their territory, and they provide some needed protection to Malibrook.

# History

# Notable Factions and Characters

# Locations
## Manufacturing Dam

- Manufacturing Dam. A large dam used to construct ships within the village. Workers here are busy finishing a boat. Large pillars of wood reinforced by iron keep a watertight seal on the water area. A pulley system operates as a crane for hoisting up large poles and masts
- The Calloused Hand hall. One of the any mead halls around the town, the Calloused Hand is warm and jolly. Here basic foods and mead are served for affordable prices, and everyone is welcome. Owned and operated by Tolla, a middle aged woman

## Town Square
- Malibrook Outposts. There is an old fortress in Mailbrook, ruined by ages past. The outpost was restored by the ashen legion, and acts as a base south of the Black Plume Mountains, a strong position for gaining information and defending against possible invades from the south. The single towered structure is home to around 20 soldiers and armaments. It is near the center of town. The acting colonel is [[Colonel Stefan Yandrick]], and [[General Yawguul]] is visiting in a recruitment effort with a small group of soldiers.
