Zitrumea is a [[Helodaria|Helodarian]] continent located to the East of [[Eranulaid]], commonly referred to as the Prime Continent, as much of the great histories of the world have deep roots in Zitrumea. Zitrumea is the western half of what used to be a much larger continent that was shattered during [[History of Helodaria#The Fall|The Fall]].
# Society
### [[Zitrumean Empire]]
Much of the continent of Zitrumea is a part of the Empire, under the Zitrum Dynasty. The empire unites many city states and peoples across the continent.
### [[Pyleas]]
The united islands, coasts and mountainous forests of Pyleas form a beautiful, diverse kingdom of art and passion. Pyleas is seen as a partial republic, as each city state is given sovereignty of its own laws, but they all answer to the Pylean King.
