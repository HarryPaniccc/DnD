# Description
Hommlet is a small village somewhere south of the [[Cresting Peaks]] in the [[Dularen Forest]] of the [[Ruina]]. It is based on the eastern bank of the [[Tirrium River]]. 

The population is mostly human, with a large halfling family, the [[Toeleather Family]] having recently been slain in their isolated homestead south of town. Their deaths were related to the goblin demon cult that sprang around 813 P.F., and marked the start of a tragic time in the village.
# History
The village was founded some four generations ago around a simple sawmill, but once metal deposits were found on the river's edge, it garnered a little bit of wealth. Circa 790 P.F. the deposits began to dry up, and it started to subsist more and more on local farming.
# Notable Factions and Characters
- [[Menan Toeleather]] is the last survivor if the [[Toeleather Family]], the family of halflings that once prospered near the town.
- [[Baylan Tsundrou]] is the half orc blacksmith

# Locations
- **Ilmater Church**: There is a church to [[Ilmater]] that sits somewhat uncomfortably in the otherwise rustic settlement. It is run by halfling the priest [[Menan Toeleather]].
