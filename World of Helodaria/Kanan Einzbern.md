# Intro
---
Kanan Einzbern is a human blood hunter-monk born of the [[Kingdom of Sirkonos]] and a member of the [[Vanguard]]. He is one of the few remaining [[Einzberns]].

Kanan was born in the [[Einzbern Hold]] in [[Keldmire]]. He was raised in the ways of monster hunting by his clan, trained by his father [[Mikael Einzbern]] alongside his brother [[Tevis Einzbern]]. His life would be turned upside down when his home and family were attacked by a vampire-lead cult who would keep him captive for two years.

One night, during a ritual in which he and his brother's eyes were cut into, Tevis would, with the help of the remaining clan who were made to watch the torture, create an opening for Kanan to flee the ordeal. By an incredible stroke of luck, Kanan would run into the legendary vampire hunter [[Jarren Ward]] wandering the halls of the cult's castle. With Jarren's help, he and Kanan would escape the cult. After Jarren's death by a necrotic wound sustained in the escape, Kanan would assume Jarren's personality and go into hiding in the [[Republic of Ruina]].
# Description

## Appearance
>*So i think at the start of the campign he was kind of on the skinnier side of things, and far less scars on his body than what he has now and his hair is like a mid tone brown with a streak of white above where his left eye was carved. He has sharp facial features with very light blue eyes that hold a very intense glare at times. By now hes definitely bulked up a lot and hes got a lot of scars accross his forearms and torso, and his previously intense glare would be replaced by something more complacent and contempt, but always calculating*

## Personality
Kanan's warm upbringing raised him to be a kind and competitive boy, but the traumatic years of his life prior to joining the [[Vanguard]] left him colder, unempathetic, and quiet. His previous empathy was replaced by a capacity for cruelty.

After the defeat of the [[Vorciln]] and the death of [[Lucius]] during the [[Battle of Strahldale]], and after his brother [[Tevis Einzbern]] was brought back to him, Kanan found his sense of leadership and retook his place as an Einzbern. Kanan found a new form of purpose and peace within himself.
