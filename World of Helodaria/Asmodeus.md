Asmodeus is one of the original [[Founding Gods]], and is the ruler over the [[Nine Hells]]. He is the devil god of power, tyranny, and lies.
# Details
---
Asmodeus takes dominion over the [[Nine Hells]], ruling from its bottom layer of [[Nessus]]. The primal embodiment of Lawful Evil, he grants power to those who are willing to take it, and punishes those who he deems deserve it. Asmodeus seeks complete control, and the idea that anyone who is not of the pantheon of gods would deny his absolute control infuriates him to his core.

It is said that his presence is so corruptive that his gaze was able to turn mortal men into tieflings that reflect his ability to enforce his will on the world. Asmodeus is a perfect embodiment of lawful evil. Corruption is pronounced with his accent.
