One of the few theatres in [[Ruina]], due to how many travelers and artisans travel through here, the theatre on main street is often a welcome method of relaxing after a long trip. The interior consists of a ticket selling room and the theatre, along with a few backstage rooms. 4 balconies decorate the inside. Owned by [[Leopoled Cassander]]. Under the stage, behind a false wall is the secret base once used as a smugglerâ€™s den, headed by the Cassander Brothers and [[Greel Sloth]]. Nowadays it's just a meeting place.
