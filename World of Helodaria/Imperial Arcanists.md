The **Imperial Arcanists** or [[Ruina]] are an order of scholars and magic users who are devoted to gathering arcane knowledge and histories from the Ruinan region. Their primary desire is to seek out and preserve knowledge.

The arcanists were founded sometime in the 6th century post-Fall by [[Ixalan the Harrowed]], a powerful mage.

# Description
### Ranks
The divisions of the order have varying degrees of independance, but all of them are ultimately answerable - at least supposed to be - to the arch mage of the Arcanists.

- **Arch Mage** of the order is the head of the order and holds a seat on the [[Uldronos Council]].
- **Masters** of the order are the various leaders that see to their respective duties and answer the the **Arch Mage**
- **Arbiters** form a leadership rank within the arcanists. Arbiters are do not follow a strict hierarchy, but are provided authority over each other by masters and their duties.
- **Arcanists** are the majority of their ranks.


### The [[Arbiters]]
The arbiters form a rank of the arcanists with a more official governmental role than those who are more loyal to their order. The arbiters often act as advisors or adjudicators to council members, overseeing official occurrences and documenting the history of [[Ruina]] in an official capacity.

The arbiters are led by the **High Arbiter**.

#### The [[Sentinels]]
A division of the arbiters that are trained in the art of espionage and field-activity. The Sentinels guard [[Ruina]] against magical threats and attempt to locate and detain any exceptional dangers to the republic.

The Sentinels were formed as a division of the [[Arbiters]] by [[Darius Nubide]] and answer directly to him above all other figures of authority.
