Firearms in this world work off a different ruleset compared to Exandria and the DMG. **Proficiency** with firearms works as a unique weapon type, as firearms are neither simple nor martial. A character without proficiency in firearms always roles a 1 on reload dice.
# Properties
## Missfire
A missfire score determines a firearms reliability on the battlefield. If the D20 roll on an attack made with a firearm rolls equal to or below the weapon's missfire score, the weapon jams. A DC 10 tinkers tools check as an action can unjam the firearm, but upon failing, the weapon will need to be repaired at a workbench over a short rest. Often the more complex the design of a firearm is, the higher the missfire score becomes.

## Reload Cost
The reload property of a firearm represents how many rounds a firearm can fire before needing to be reloaded. A weapon must be reloaded after firing a number of shots equal to its reload score.

The reload property of most firearms has a loading time of 30 seconds (5 actions). Some weapons have a cost in their reload property, defining the amount of actions required to be "paid" to load a single round into the weapon. Reloading usually requires the use of ignition paper, black powder (or an alternative powder), the bullet, and a plunger or plunging mechanism. Some weapons use pre-loaded packets of powder which drastically can reduce their reload score.

If the reload property of a firearm includes a die, the firearm is designed in such a way that it can have many rounds reloaded as an action during combat, as opposed to paying the reload duration to reload one of the chambers. As an action, you may roll the reload die and load a number of rounds into the weapon equal to the number rolled on the die. Weapons that possess this property usually have some kind of quick-loading apparatus that is used to pack pre-packed rounds into the chambers, or uses some form of advanced chamber or rounds.
## Loading
Some firearms are designed with the intent to be quick to reload. The loading property works the same as with simple and martial weapons. Effects that require you to do some action to reload a firearm, it is assumed that a firearm with loading is reloaded at the end of your turn.

# Farrondale Firearms
The Farrondale family has been instrumental in developing proper casings for faster reloads. With only a single chamber and the difficulty being reloading after firing, the Farrondale family developed a kind of paper powder casing with a round in it that makes for very quick reloads, as it has been prepacked. Compared to a normal musket, which takes a long time to reload, Farrondale weapons are extremely valuable and highly regulated.
