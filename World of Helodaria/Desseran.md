# History
---
Desseran's history stretches back to before even the [[Age of Ascension]], likely beginning before even the [[Age of Wounds]], which could make it up to tens of thousands of years old. The city is so important, that its history is inseperably impactful on the [[Eranulaid History|History of Eranulaid]].

Desseran is famously home to the seeds of [[Human|Humanity]].

[[Bahamut]], [[Lathander]] and [[The Raven Queen]] defended Desseran during the [[Dawn War]]. Dragonborn clans united under the ancient human kings.
### Founding of the [[Desseran Apostolate]]
Some time during the [[Age of Wounds]], the three god avatars of the [[Desseran Apostolate]] were sent by their parents in their stead to watch over the holy birthplace of humanity. Under the rule of the avatars, the city grows and flourishes. Beneath [[Unnamed Avatar of the Bahamut]], the beginnings of the [[Silver Talon]] are formed.

During the [[Age of Ascension]], [[Unnamed Avatar of Lathander]] and [[Unnamed Avatar of the Raven Queen]] leave the city under the rule of [[Unnamed Avatar of the Bahamut]].
### The [[Thay|Empire of Thay]]
Some time during the [[Age of Ascension]], a cabal of spellcasters known as the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] used profane rituals to elicit the help of the demon lord [[Eltab]] to attack and betray Desseran's leadership, defeating [[Unnamed Avatar of the Bahamut]] and establishing rule over the city. Once control over Desseran was established, the Wizards imprisoned Eltab beneath [[Diredahl]] in [[Dun Murroc]] - a bastion controlled by Desseran at the time.

For a great part of the Age of Ascension, Desseran acted as the capital for the Thayan empire.
