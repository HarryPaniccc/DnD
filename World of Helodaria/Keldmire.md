# Description
Home of the Einzberns. The city is largely paved and well structured, a mish mash of side alleys and central roads. Large arteries of pathways connect the main open areas with each other, while the smaller byways intersect almost all locations in the city just as well. The city works off of wine and farm trade. There are many trees throughout the area, and a couple markets.
# History

# Notable Characters

- [[Heinrich Fibblethumb]]. Owner and runner of the Zwei Hunde. Gnome of long white hair usually in a bun, and a gentle beard. Caring and sometimes stern.
- [[Shrute]]. Owner of Shrute’s Alchemy. Large slightly yellow-green firbolg. Deep and slow of tone, and is respected by many of the community
- [[Markus Serezo]] - deceased. Think physicality of doomfist. Voice of a deeper J'zargo. He is an oni in disguise. He is currently acting as sheriff to Keldmire, keeping the profits of the town for himself and his goons. He always has a pair of Hollow Guardians with him. The form he wears gives the suspicion of an orc in its lineage, maybe two or three generations removed.**
# Locations
- **The Marketplace**. Bustling as ever, the low-lying marketplace is half-covered in a roof of leaves from the oak trees that are found around it. At the centre of the city, this is where most people would have passed through when going through the town, so there are many inns and taverns laced throughout it.
- **Die Zwei Hunde**. Low lying tavern run by [[Heinirich Fibblethumb]]. It has a bar and some upstairs rooms, as well as a secret underground hiding place hidden behind a large barrel by means of a complicated contraption in the walls.
- **Theatre House**. ~~The theatre has been converted into a bar and tavern of sorts for Sheriff Sorezo’s men, with Sorezo living in the manor itself. No one has staged a play in a long time.~~
- **Schrute’s Alchemy**. A relatively tight space given who owns it. [[Shrute]] constantly has to be slouched, and behind the counter is actually dug a little bit lower to accommodate the firbolgs height. There is an attached greenhouse.
- [[Einzbern Manor]]. Dilapidated in the years after the Inquisition, it is now being watched quite consistently by the Vorciln. The place is a labyrinth of knowledge and a deathtrap for those who are unprepared to enter. A rusted iron fence surrounds the grounds, and atop a hill stands the old manor.
