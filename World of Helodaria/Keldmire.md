# Description
Home of the Einzberns. The city is largely paved and well structured, a mish-mash of side alleys and central roads. Large arteries of pathways connect the main open areas with each other, while the smaller byways intersect almost all locations in the city just as well. The city works off of wine and farm trade. There are many trees throughout the area, and a couple markets.
# History

# Notable Characters

- [[Heinrich Fibblethumb]]. Owner and runner of the Zwei Hunde. Gnome of long white hair usually in a bun, and a gentle beard. Caring and sometimes stern Sirkonian accent.
- [[Shrute]]. Owner of Shrute’s Alchemy. Large slightly yellow-green firbolg. Deep and slow of tone, and is respected by many of the community
- [[Markus Serezo]] (deceased). Think physicality of doomfist. Voice of a deeper J'zargo. He is an oni in disguise. He is currently acting as sheriff to Keldmire, keeping the profits of the town for himself and his goons. He always has a pair of Hollow Guardians with him. The form he wears gives the suspicion of an orc in its lineage, maybe two or three generations removed.
- [[Rowan]]. Sheriff's Captain of the guard that protects Keldmire.
- [[Doldrum son of Doldrum]] is a dwarf of deep orange hair who runs **Doldrum Carpentry**. Sounds like the "bless you" dwarf from that one meme.
- [[Baron Owen Luthrand]]. Human aristocrat and father of [[Viscount Gale Luthrand]] and [[Lady Leah Luthrand]]. Long but well kept black hair.
- [[Lady Leah Luthrand]]. Human aristocrat of deep brown almost black hair. Rather timid sister of [[Viscount Gale Luthrand]]
# Locations
- **The Marketplace**. Bustling as ever, the low-lying marketplace is half-covered in a roof of leaves from the oak trees that are found around it. At the centre of the city, this is where most people would have passed through when going through the town, so there are many inns and taverns laced throughout it.
- **Die Zwei Hunde**. Low lying tavern run by [[Heinirich Fibblethumb]]. It has a bar and some upstairs rooms, as well as a secret underground hiding place hidden behind a large barrel by means of a complicated contraption in the walls.
- **Theatre House**. ~~The theatre has been converted into a bar and tavern of sorts for Sheriff Sorezo’s men, with Sorezo living in the manor itself. No one has staged a play in a long time.~~ 
- **[[Schrute’s Alchemy]]**. A relatively tight space given who owns it. [[Shrute]] constantly has to be slouched, and behind the counter is actually dug a little bit lower to accommodate the firbolg's height. There is an attached greenhouse.
- [[Einzbern Hold]]. Dilapidated in the years after the Inquisition, it is now being watched quite consistently by the Vorciln. The place is a labyrinth of knowledge and a deathtrap for those who are unprepared to enter. A rusted iron fence surrounds the grounds, and atop a hill stands the old manor.
- **Doldrum Carpentry**. A low-lying stone structure with a windmill atop a wooden warehouse off to the side where a large amount of woodwork is done. The doors, windows, tables, floors and even the sign is crafted with exceptional skill. To the left of the entrance is a large pile of various kinds of unworked lumber and the smell of polish and varnish and sawdust is about the area. [[Doldrum son of Doldrum]] runs the front of house while also overseeing the warehouse.
- [[Luthrand Manor]] is an hour's ride West of the city proper.
