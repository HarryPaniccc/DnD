# Description
### Appearance
An infernoguard tower is a 20 foot tall stone and steel statue construct, decorated with gold and a large red gem in their weapon. The crystal is infused with magical fire and absorbs it.
### Lore

# Functionality
An infernoguard tower functions as a protective ward against fire. While within 100ft. of a tower, all sources of fire damage that a creature receives are halved. Any damage reduced by this amount charges up the crystal. Once the crystal has prevented 200 points of fire damage, it is charged and can fire its beam.
