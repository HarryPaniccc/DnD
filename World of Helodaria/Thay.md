**The Empire of Thay** was the first great empire of the world that shattered during [[The Fall]]. It stretched across much of modern day [[Eranulaid]]. The cities [[Diredahl]] and [[Desseran]] are the only remaining cities of the original empire that are still inhabited.

The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and the [[Thayan Orthodoxy]] are different things. They are not the same. The Orthodoxy came about due to the experiences of the people of [[Thay]] during [[The Fall]], and the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] are a faction that once led [[Thay]] but now form part of the [[Desseran|Desseranian]] government.

The history of Thay is deeply tied to the [[Eranulaid History|History of Eranulaid]].
