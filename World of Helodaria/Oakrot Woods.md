The huge swamp near the centre of the [[Ruina]], surrounded plains and grasses. Known for its slow rotting death, the northern part of the swamp is safer and often is passed by ships going from the central river. The swamp is known for having a slight demonic presence throughout, as some of the rot and decay is even unnatural in nature. Worshipers of [[Orcus]] and [[Malar]], the lord of slaughter situate themselves about the area, and a small kingdom that fell to demonic invasion, which is the source of the decay. The area is also known for natural life cycling, with the animals and plants thriving off of rot.Â 

The remnant abyssal corruption is noticeable in a few ways once you approach the remaining ruins that the swamp has not consumed. Notable signs of the corruption include the tree roots resembling spines.
