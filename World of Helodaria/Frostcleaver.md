**Frostcleaver** is an adult white dragon allied with the [[Sunblight Clan]] in the [[Faults of North Estravia]]. The dragon was sealed in a prison which eventually became its lair circa 750 PF. Since then, the [[Sunblight Clan]] has freed the dragon and now a tentative alliance exists between the two. Her territory is small for an adult dragon, as she fears repercussions for encroaching on the older, more powerful dragons around her lair. For this reason, she spends most of her time within icy caverns.

The below statblock is simply an [[Adult White Dragon]] modified. Frostcleaver is an adult white dragon with 600 hp.
