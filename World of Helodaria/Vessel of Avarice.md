The Vessel of Avarice is an artefact forged before the end of the Age of Ascension. It was used by [[Athelstan]] to claim the power of the sun and the stars and become a vampire that was able to drink light.
# Vessel of Avarice
*Wondrous Item, Artefact, Requires Attunement*
**Artefact Properties**. The Vessel has the following properties, which you gain while attuned to it:
- Minor Beneficial Properties: You are immune to disease and you gain proficiency in one skill.
- Major Beneficial Property: You can use a reaction to cast *Soul Cage* from the Vessel. After you cast the spell, roll a D6. On a roll of 1-5 you cannot cast the spell again until the next dawn.
- Minor Detrimental Properties: All holy water within 10 feet of you is destroyed. In addition you must eat and drink six times the normal amount every day.
- Major Detrimental Properties: Before using any of the Vessel's properties as an action you must use a bonus action to draw blood from a willing or incapacitated creature within reach using a piercing or slashing weapon. The subject takes 1d4 damage of the appropriate type. 
  In addition, due to the permanent connection the vessel has to the Blood Fey, when you use an action or channel a ritual to use one of the artefact's properties there is a 50 percent chance that Athelstan tries to possess you through the vessel. You must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or have Athelstan take over your physical form. Until his will is banished by a dispel evil and good spell or similar magic, you become an NPC under the DM's control.

**Siphon Power**. The Vessel is a channel for arcane power, allowing for the siphoning of this power from one state to another. It is this magic that granted Athelstan the power he has now. In order to use this feature, you must draw blood as described above. In addition, any benefits incurred to any target may alter the target in an unforeseen way.
**Item to Creature**. Over the course of a 1 minute ritual you consume an item of your choice, granting benefits depending on the rarity of the item to a target creature that is within 30 feet of you over the course of the ritual.
- *Common*: Gain 10 temporary hit points until the next long rest
- *Uncommon*: Gain 20 temporary hit points until the next long rest
- *Rare*: Permanently increase their maximum hit points by 4 and gain advantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the next long rest
- *Very Rare*: Permanently increase their maximum hit points by 10 and give them advantage on all checks, saves, and attack rolls until the next long rest 
- *Legendary*: Permanently increase one of their ability scores and that score's maximum by 2.
- Additional effects can be granted for different items too, depending on their nature.

**Creature to Item**. Over the course of a ritual targeting an item and one or more sacrificed creatures, you grant the item a benefit relating to the essence of the creature being siphoned. The ritual takes one hour for a living creature, or one minute if a creature's soul is being held in the Vessel's *Soul Cage*. This ritual destroys the creature's forms or souls and yields different results depending on the nature of the target item, the power of the creatures and the number of creatures, as well as other elements relating to the ritual. Lucius was able to create *Vorciln Tithing Blades* using infernal iron and the blood of ten sacrificed innocents.
**Extended Channeling**. In addition to the above rituals that it can be used for, the Vessel is able to act as a magical focus for many specific harnessing rituals. The nature of the ritual will often decide what is required as its costs and its outcomes.
