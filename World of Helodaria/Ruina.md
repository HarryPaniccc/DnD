Ruina is a young republic on the continent of [[Eranulaid]]. It was founded around 200 PF.

A young and prosperous republic, forged with the combined efforts of patrons hailing from across Helodaria, the diversity of the Ruinan Republic is accentuated by the ambitions of the [[Uldronos Council]], its ruling table of leaders from across the material plane. The Republic is situated atop the long forgotten remnants of a war that took place during the beginning of the Fall, its artefacts and history beginning to make themselves known only in recent years.

The Republic’s access to a rich landscape of excellent natural resources and varied environments have made obvious that it has a strong foothold as a major centrepiece of the modern world order, even though there are rising tensions on whether or not the Uldronos Council should continue to operate as it always has within its own government.
# History
---
### Pre-settlement and Settlement (Circa 0 P.F.)
The shores of the [[Allhaven]] port were first settled near the end of the Fall, but for a long time the settlement was little more than just a port from which the spoils of the [[Platinum Highroad]] were shipped, supplying platinum to a large portion of [[Zitrumea]].

After the fall, investments of the surviving noble houses began to funnel into the beginnings of the republic, and for around 200 years, the platinum trade flourished under the control of foreign guilds. After a while, the locals, who at this point had developed family roots in the area, began to realize the value of the nation that was growing, and wanted to establish Ruina as its own governed nation. So, the citizens of the then New-Ruinan Republic elected families that would each represent a portion of the race to which they belonged, so to ensure fair word for all. This marked the formation of the hereditary Uldronos Council, who still govern the Republic over 600 years later.

### Founding of [[Uldronos Council]]
For a few years, a patchwork government protected trade routes and mostly kept the peace. After some time, a council of 14 members were elected based on an equal representation-population ratio, in which the amount of members from a race seated in the council would be a fraction of the council that is equal to the fraction of the population that represents that race. The council seats were hereditary, and in case an heir would not be found, the next of kin within the noble house would take the seat upon their death.

Over time, the council adapted its membership, and adopted a few new seats as larger factions grew to power. The non-hereditary seats include the Arch Mage of the [[Imperial Arcanists]] and the [[High Paladin of Tyr]].

# Geography
---
The Republic is on the Eastern Shores of the northmost continent of [[Eranulaid]]. To the north are the [[Maghlas Mountains]], just north past the [[Shard Foothills]]. To the west sits the [[Mungandr Lake]] which leads to the ocean. At the centre of the Republic sits the [[Amberloch]], connected via the [[Eithval River]] to the [[Oakrot Woods]]. The [[Dularen Plains]] makes up the core of the Republic's territory. The [[Ashen Peaks]] form a barrier between the plains and [[Ralengrad]]. At the centre of the republic sits the [[Cresting Peaks]].

### [[Mungandr Lake]]
A massive lake that marks the western border of Ruina.

- [[Ironbase]]: A small settlement of farmers built around an old fortress left to the elements and the ages.
### The [[Dularen Plains]] and [[Platinum Highroad]]
The center of the Republic, the Dularen Plains is a region of great prosperity for the Republic's people.

- [[Splitmount]]: At the entrance to the valley, the farming town provides a large portion of the empire with farm produce. 
- [[Vasspryg]]: A medium sized city surrounded by a strong fortress. There is a small export of valuable minerals from the mines in the mountain.
- [[Midvale]]. A town built due to the crossing of the [[Platinum Highroad]] and the [[Eithval River]] 
- [[Malibrook]]. A somewhat medium sized town of vessel construction. Built due to the volcanically enforced wood providing a valuable construction material.
- [[Dularen]]. An incredibly large working class city of opportunity, whether above board or not. The city is largely at the centre of control of the republic, and every major faction has a hold here.  
- The [[Wyrm Hole]] was, in ancient times, a nest for a large collection of dragons. In modern times, it used to house a powerful adult dragon that was slain by the Ashen Legion. Now the Wyrm Hole is a mining city of perpetual work, exporting everything from iron to copper to even some mithril.
- The [[Eithval River]] splits the plains in two.

### The [[Oakrot Woods]]
The Oakrot is a huge swamp off the shores of the [[Amberloch]]. The area is known for natural life cycling and an expedient cycle of life and death, the animals and plants thriving off of rot.

### The [[Cinder Valley]]
The region to the north of the [[Ashen Peaks]], the valley houses the Sovereignty of [[Ralengrad]].

- [[Bridgehold]]: A small community on the southern side of the [[Bridge of Giants]].
- [[Ashfort]]: A massive castle city atop a cliff face, and home to the [[Ashen Legion]].
- [[Ralengrad]]: Also the name of the city that surrounds the base of Ashfort.

### The [[Amberloch]]
#TODO 

- [[Mountreach]]: A mountain-city of the old Ruinan empire. Home to the largest population of dwarves in the republic.
- [[Tirrium River]]: is the large northern tributary of the Amberloch that flows from the [[Cresting Peaks]].

### The [[Cresting Peaks]]

- [[Hommlet]]: A small mining village in the foothills of the cresting peaks based along the [[Tirrium River]].
- [[Ironspine Pass]]: A road that leads up the cresting peaks from a bit into the [[Dularen Forest]]. Somewhere along the pass there exists a tomb of paladins dedicated to [[Lathander]].

## Culture
Groups of settlers from around the world and almost broke into war.

## Politics
### The [[Uldronos Council]]
The Uldronos Council is a hereditary council, ruled by houses that were elected around 200 P.F. The Council does not hand out duties to specific houses, but some houses have naturally swayed towards fulfilling a role in governing the Republic.
## Military
### The [[Ruinan Guard]]
The [[High Paladin of Tyr]] has the primary say in the law making of Ruina and ensuring that the laws are fairly upheld. The militant group of guards uphold the laws in the official Republic cities and towns, each overseen by a Guard Steward assigned to a specific settlement. They are recognisable by their uniforms: well kept leather and scale-male, a steel helmet, and a halberd, as well as their own personal cloaks are allowed to combat the cold Ruinan winters.
### The [[Boreal Conclave]]
## [[Religion]]
The Republic of Ruina has many major gods that they worship, with other deities being worshipped alongside. The main deity worshipped is Tyr, and the [[High Paladin of Tyr]] oversees the [[Lawbearers]], and acts as the High Temple of Pantheon’s Voice on the Uldronos Council. There are gods that are not recognised as legal in Ruina, and then there are gods that are heretical to worship.

## The Wyrm Hole

A low lying mining town, the real name of the Wyrm Hole is Togdal, but since the town descended in shelves around the entrance to the hole. The Town itself spreads for a distance north around the Hole itself, which in itself is around 5km in diameter. The once dragon infested nest is surrounded on the southern end by a botallion of aged and destroyed Ashen legion armaments, now home to the riff raff of the city. 

The working class city is less friendly to outsiders. 

Once being den for an adult red dragon, who had kept his exploits below ground for many years, the drake decided for whatever reason to go above ground and raid the surrounding settlements. His presence was known before, however the powers that be decided that he hadn’t presented a true threat to the empire that was worth the bodies to deal with. After his resurgence, a large collection of mercenaries and bounty hunters, along with a small guild of shields for hire were paid a handsome amount to work alongside the guard and display the empire’s militant skill. What followed was the forming of the Ashen Legion, so named due to the men who were unable to be defeated by the fires of a terrible dragon. 


The guards of the city are outfitted with light crossbows as opposed to the swords and shields of the usual guard. They deal with a somewhat large amount of illegal activity in this lower-middle class settlement. They try to keep a watchful eye out for anything that could damage the empire.

  

Buildings 

  

The city is made into 3 sections, each with a mesh of functions. The main cityscape area above the Hole is Urban living areas. There one can find markets, taverns, inns, pubs and a sprinkling of a few shops of quality, but mostly the things that can be bought in the Hole are all functional. 

  

The sections are: The Surface, The Rings and the Mines.

  

Note: the duergar clan that lives under the city has a brand/clan symbol is one of two fisted gauntlets slammed together.

  

On the surface:

- The Overflow Tavern. Located close to the edge. A single floored worker’s tavern. A long bar that wraps around the far left corner separates the main area from what is around 24 barrels of ale and mead on tap. Above the barrels are metallic, clean mugs. The drinks available are winterberry brew and Valouce Ale. Food available is bread and cheese, simple and filling. The place provides 4 poor single rooms. Run by hearty Dwarf man George.
    
- Feathered Nest inn. A more comfortable, Modest inn close to the center of town, the Feathered Nest provides many services to travelers. The double storeyed mortar based wooden structure is warm with a hearth in the center that heats the very floor of the top storey. Often there is a pig or cow over the fire, made to keep the patrons fed. They provide comfortable beds with double rooms, along with a stable service and feed for the horses. The owner is human Bridgette Osuf. The bard Eren plays there every night.
    
- Faultline pub. A somewhat dirty pub, built more out of necessity than a need for drink. Run by water genasi gentleman, Aren.
    
- Allhammer’s Kiln. Located in the richer part of the surface, the steel structure is smooth and definitively dwarvish in structure, with geometric continuous lines carved into each face of the square based steel support columns. The entrance is flanked on either side by one of these columns, opening into a structure that is small, yet grand, centered on an anvil atop a set of stairs, with a hammer leaning onto the side of it. This is a fabled Moradin smithy, a traditional, holy place of craftsmanship, used only for special occasions. The room is comparatively dark, with braziers at each corner. The roof is a geometry of dwarf carvings made from steel, gold and bronze, each with intricate carvings, layered on top of a primarily marble structure. Two acolytes are stationed watching the Anvil at all times of opening hours. Usually, Priest Marlon Greydor.
    
- Needle and Treads Tailor. A simple, functional tailors that makes solid, lasting working clothes. Run by a human man with no hair and a sort of half goatee. Sounds and acts like he’s hiding something. He won't divulge his name.
    
- Cinderbreak Forge. Probably the highest quality steel working spot in town, located close to the edge, the Cinderbreak is a large establishment. The main building is a steel building with a mortar roof. Inside is a warm shop with racks of weapons, shields, swords, crossbows and a few sets of armour being displayed, as well as a large collection of miner’s tools and working items. To the left of the main building there is a courtyard with a metal roof to keep the elements away from the large coal forge. Behind the counter of the shop sits Halfling Girl Reeka, and working the forge is Tabaxi man Yngol Ferrun. Main items on sale are
    

- Primarily Scimitars, as they remind Yngol of home
    
- A set of quality Chainmail, Splint and Ringmail armour
    
- A few great axes for the folks who come from the baronies
    

There are a few dwarves working alongside Yngol

- There is a large residential area on the far west of town where most of the people live. Homes stretch from simple house to large manor
    
- Ogendredt Keep. The city is one of the major bases for the army of the Empire, the Boreal Conclave. Ogendredt Keep is a large fortress surrounded by a large wall set with ballistas on large platform battlements. The compound is equipped with an armoury, stables, sparring ring, and the primary fortress. The main structure is built of stone with wooden doors, stairways on the exterior to the multiple layers that the building consists of. Battlements adorn the outside of the main building, connected to the roofs by steps. The entire building is made to be defended. The compound is leaded by Major Drinma Uxolon.
    
- There are a few guard postings around the city. 
    
- There is a splattering of livestock pens around the city with mostly pigs but there is also a few cows for milk.
    
- The Jarls Manor is a luxurious structure within the Ogendredt keep compound. It is surrounded by a large stone wall and guarded by a small botallion of guards. Jarl Rosalind is often busy with the higher ups of the city. There are many stories.
    

  

There is a market square on the surface in between the outskirts of town and the edge.

- The Soldering House. A lower quality smith and knife making business. Run by Dwarf man Agos.
    
- Food market. A somewhat large fresh farmers produce market that supplies a variety of foods and ingredients to the hole. Here, you can find fish, beef, pork, chicken, fruits, vegetables and some drinks.
    
- Butchers run by a human man with a prosthetic for a right hand that he has as a knife attachment
    

  
  

The lower down the wall you go, the more dedicated to industry the place becomes, with a few streets per shelf. Peering over, one sees at areas the shelf spirals down a layer, and stops after around 3 and a half rotations. From there it goes out and down, growing into the rock lining the hole. Below that the mines are accessible from altered natural pathways.

  

In the Rings:

- The Conversation Tavern. A middle ring tavern built in front of an old mine that is forgotten by many of the law. It is a front for the base of the Devil's Hand. The entrance area houses an often empty bar run by human Idris Ward. The place has a large stables and barn area, and the stairs above the bar leads to the den of the Devil’s Hand.
    

- The den is a large, repurposed mining cavern with a bar headed by Human Douglas, a large mining tunnel used to get things in and out of the city with many goods around it, a collection of tables around which sit a few hard okes, a forge where the items needed for this life are made. In the middle there is a circle carved in the ground that functions as a fighting pit. Dwarf man Kilo is the reigning champion. Weapons are allowed and its your responsibility to not die. There is also a second large mining tunnel where there are varied sizes of cages used for smuggling creatures or slaves. Everything is 1 gold piece
    

- The Yawning Servant pub. A hard tack rot-gut bar made for and run by Dwarves. The place mostly tends to miners who have come off a days work. Very low ring. Run by assorted dwarf women.
    
- Eager Tongue brothel. The madam of which is a half elf woman who takes no shit. Matt Mercer woman voice.
    
- Ironstone Foundry. The Ironstones are an old dwarf clan and the wealthiest family in the city. They own the mithril mine and make a not-so-small fortune. Currently the foundry converts them into ingots and sells them to the Empire and the public for a pretty penny. 2500Gp per ingot. The structure is a metallic sloped building, dwarf architecture. There is a secretary working there at almost all times. The workshop consists of many ingot casts and is manned by hardy dwarves and humans. It is located in the lower rings. Headed up by Eidgar Ironstone.
    
- Ironstone Cellars. Located in the upper rings, the wine made here is aged under perfect temperature conditions provided by the caves. One barrel of their house vintage fetches 500Gp, with a bottle reaching 100Gp. Often Lena Ironstone can be found managing the winery. Many other wines are sold.
    
- Igleflask brewery. Owned by the aussie brown ish colour red dragonborn named Oliver. He is a purveyor of magical items in the town. Its a somewhat small trading area sort of provides the top ring with potions and magical short use items.
    
- Somethin’s Brewin’. Potion and alchemist shop built in the lower rings specifically dedicated to the creation of potions.
    

  

Mines:

- Ironstone iron mine. The Ironstone iron mine is owned by the Ironstone dwarf clan, a side investment that leads to a small arms smuggling route, where a larger amount of income has been generated.
    
- Ironstone mithral mine. A far smarter and more well organized operation than the iron mine, the mithral mine is an incredibly well guarded cavern that is held above one’s head by dwarvish stone pillared architecture, inlaid with steel supports, lit up by arcane lamps that give a cool, almost purple glow. This ribbed support structure, continues for a good 100 meters into the cavern, oftentimes the cavern expanding so that the structure is not connected to the roof of the natural tunnel. It goes down a flight of steps once every while. Arteries spread off sideways, where the mine proper is conducted. Many workers spend their hours chipping away at the rich mithril ore, which takes much longer to chip away than normal ore.

Allhaven is a centre for international trade, ships coming in from Pyleas and Zitrumean Cities all year round. The bay in which it is seated often holds fishing vessels during the day. The outer walls of the city. ADD HEART-KILN

## Arcanstead

The Menagerie Scholarship

## Ralengrad

The city of Ralengrad is watched over by the Ashfort and directly protected by the Ashen Legion and Holdren’s leadership. There is a high wall surrounding it with large braziers at regular intervals. The city curls up the mountain like a snake, at the end of which is a grand castle that overlooks the entire of the Valley. The streets are tightly packed and often at angles from one another, and patrolled by Ashen Legion. There are smithies, bars and bakeries, butchers, farmers markets and livestock pens, as well as houses.

  

Two Halves of the same, Ashen Coin

The city is pretty well divided in two, the majority of the ashen legion defences are on the higher end of the city, protecting the Lothir Keep and the army force within its boundaries. Less of the city is found here but still a large variety of structures, as well as Lothir Castle itself.

  

Lothir Keep

The inner walls defend Lothir Keep, where the majority of the siege engines, weapons, army force and stables are kept. The area is akin to the undertown, but the more you ascend, the more castlekeep-like it becomes. At the very edge of the cliff, overlooking the town and the Valley is Lothir Castle, a bastion of modern military work, with some storm giant design elements to the stonework.

- Lothir Castle is 
    
- The Steel Mill
    
- The Teleportation Circle Tower is a small, single story structure away from the main castle with a permanent teleportation circle. The stone structure is always defended by two armoured guards.
    

  

The Undertown

The majority of Ralengrad is the undertown, a somewhat slanted mishmash of cultures and structures that have been built as the need arises. The defensive wall surrounds the city and locks in its outer perimeter, and people try to stay within city walls. The roads are paved and well trodden. One can find inns, bars, smithies, armourers, tailors, general goods stores, as well as fighting rings, to pass the time, but keeping the fort together is a large focus for the citizens of Ralengrad.

- Fallow Mire Inn
    
- Temple of Tyr. A simple Church structure that gives a place of holiness to the people of Ralengrad. It is headed by the monk Kald.
    

  

NPCs

- Kald is a very muscular human man. He is a monk that tends to the Temple of Tyr in the undertown. He often wears simple shirts despite any weather.
    

## Wraithhold

The low, barely sheltered village of Wraithhold is surrounded by a defensive wall which is guarded by Ashen Legion against the creatures that roam the Shiver. The town is situated on the Frozen Flats, a lake that is usually covered in a layer of ice, which harbours a few cold water dwelling fish caught by ice fishermen. Otherwise, the people of Wraithhold keep livestock in warm pens, hunt northern dwelling animals, and trade ice from the flats for coin.

  

Frozen Flats

The large permanently frozen lake provides most of the industry out of Wraithhold, as a handful of ice cutter vessels extract the ice from the lake in large chunks year round and ship it all around the empire to those who can afford such an expense. Beneath the ice, there is also a large, isolated ecosystem of marine life.

Buildings

- Sheltered Candle inn.The inn is a low lying triangular, log cabin type structure with a central supportive chimney that often has a fire burning in it. The centre of the structure is a common eatery room and the sides are segmented into 6 rooms, one which belongs to the owner. There is a stable beside it, and the Dwarf Owner Thulmand Eichenwalde.
    
- Guard’s Hall. A simple brick guards barracks where the Legion Soldiers stay while they patrol the area. It is built in a sort of crescent shape with a large tree in the middle, somehow staving off dying from the cold.
    
- Stalker’s Maw is a small monster hunting guild outpost from Ralengrad. The hunters come from Ralengrad to earn a bit of extra coin when there is little available work in the main city. The structure seems like a bastion just sprouted out of the middle of a thin rectangular building. The most permanent of attendants is the Ranger (Monster Hunter) Py’r Astrus.
    
- Village Forge is a very warm building where Chandler works to provide the metalwork for the village
    
- Docks. Where the icing and fishing companies are situated. Often working through the day hauling large pieces of ice through the lake to shore to be cut into smaller pieces. The largest ship on the dock is the Icebreaker simply named “The axe”.

She wears light-painted leathers to fit into the colder environment where she hunts, and wields a longbow. Gentle voice with an exuberant tone, slight Irish
    
- Idriu is an older human who owns a house near the Sheltered Candle inn.
    
- Chandler Dwarf man. Tied up red hair. Hoarse voice few words. Eastern European

## Seidrheim

Situated on the Seidr Plateau, Seidrheim is a separate government from the Empire of Ruina. A farming town that takes advantage of the year-round temperateness of the Plateau’s environment, winter hits a little bit lighter and summer has a little bit more rain, the town is surrounded by a network of seemingly random crops. Somewhere on the plateau roams a herd of huge cattle known as the Seidth Horns, known for their beautiful meats and incredible value.

  

Buildings

- Redflank castle. The large homestead of Lady Soraya Wishruld. The guard barracks, trial house and goal are adjacent to the structure
    
- Waystone Inn. A small, four table establishment with three rooms suitable for 3 people each. Owned by Tindran

# Out Of Ruina

## The [[Living Vault of Uladar]]

Constructed during the ages of the fall by a selection of mages from the societies of old Ruina, the Living Vault of [[Uladar]] is a multipurpose demiplane that serves as a grand campus of magical study and invention, a dungeon for those who are unwelcome, and a prison made to hold abominations that the mages who created the vault could simply no put down.
  

The [[Uladar Lattice]]

The main method of accessing the various entrances to the vault is the Uladar Lattice, a cube of complex interlocking sections with various modes and configurations. Many configurations are not associated with a destination, however if a correct sequence is inputted and 8 levels worth of spells are cast into the cube, then a small doorway of magical energy will appear that leads to the section inputted.

### Sections

Gore Horn Labyrinth

Udyr the Gore Horn was a terrible warrior in service of the God of Slaughter, Malar, during the Fall. The creature proved unkillable during the fall, and so had to be imprisoned. No conventional prison would hold the beast, however, so the mages of creators of the vault constructed a prison that would be tailored for his minotaur nature - a labyrinth that would be ever changing, so that he could never find the exit.

The space that he would be captured in would be ever changing, with some doorways being only one way, walls of stone appearing should one try to turn back through them. Escape for a non-spellcaster would be impossible, and the only real way to leave would be via the use of a spell such as dimension door or some other displacement spell. Alternatively, destroying the floor can reasonably get one to the Arcane Core that powers the mechanism.

## The Blood Drain

A polluted and corrupted corner of the Feywild, the Blood Drain is home to many forms of evil. The self proclaimed ruler of these forces is Athelstan the Blood Fey, a powerful elemental fey worshipped by some vampiric cults as a blood god. He is bound to Kanan Einzbern, and hates the Einzbern family. 

The ground here is charred and scarred by pools of blood. In contrast to the rest of the Feywild, the eternal Twilight is replaced by a permanent red-sunned eclipse. The streams of arcane energy are instead rivers of curses, the water a murky blood and tasting of sulphur. The landscape is barren, a mix of dusty hills and mountains segregated by forests of dying trees filled with nightmares and monstrosities.

The inhabitants include shadow dragons, werewolves that have no control over their murderous instincts, vampire thralls that cannot become true vampires and drow who worship Athelstan.
