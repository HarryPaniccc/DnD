# Intro
---
Isilme Vanariel is a half-elf echo knight fighter and a member of the [[Vanguard]].

Isilme was born in [[Dularen]], the bastard child to a noble elf family [[House Vanariel]] who sat on the [[Uldronos Council]] of the [[Republic of Ruina]]. Unloved by her elf mother's family, particularly by her grandfather, Isilme was raised in the ranks of the house's personal guard. She lived a hard life, not in poverty and surrounded by a hard but strong community, she learnt to play the warrior guard that the house needed.

One night while acting on her guard shift, the home of [[House Vanariel]] was raided by the guards of Dularen and [[Lawbearers]] under the charge of conspiring with dark magics for personal gain. In the dungeons of the manor, Isilme freed a shadow entity trapped within a painting that became known to her as [[Smudge]], and the two of them set out into the world, finally free of both of their ties.
# Description

## Appearance
Isilme is a late twenties half elf of light skin and long flowing deep black hair. Her features are sharp and her eyes are a vibrant purple. She wears her hair in an expertly crafted braid while in combat so that it stays out of her way under her helmet, but it is worn in a variety of fashions outside of combat. She is around 6 feet tall with a very strong, muscular build.

Isilme wears a longsword of deep gray and flakes of obsidian with her at all times, known as the [[Blade of Despair]]. In battle Isilme wears dark heavy plate armor with sharp adamantine modifications and a standard that acts almost as a battle dress. Her helmet conceals her entire face and her black braided hair can be seen trailing out of the back of it.

Isilme's eyes were blue before [[Smudge]] joined her. After the night that [[Castle Anavar]] fell, they turned purple. Otherwise, her hair and feature bare a very strong resemblance to [[Ulrandir Vanariel]].

After undergoing an [[Einzberns|Einzbern]] transformation process in which she became a [[Dhampir]], Isilme's eyes turned bright red and her hair shone a beautiful silver white. Her fingernails extended into claws and her canines sharpened into Vampire fangs.

## Before the Campaign
Isilme was raised in the guards quarters of [[Castle Anavar]] in the city center of [[Dularen]]. She is the bastard child of two families: Her mother is the child of [[House Vanariel]] of the [[Uldronos Council]], whose father once sat on the council. Her father was the lieutenant of the guard of the house and formed a romantic relationship with Isilme's mother. When the pregnancy was discovered by [[Ulrandir Vanariel|Ulrandir]], Isilme's grandfather, Isilme's father disappeared from Dularen and was not seen again. 

Isilme was raised in the ranks of the guards, her mother was unable to either part with her completely, but she was unable to provide her any love either. [[Minra Vanariel|Minra]], Isilme's mother, learned to eventually ignore her feelings for Isilme, and grew colder as Isilme grew older, but never really managed to let Isilme go. Minra later remarried a high elf baron in an arranged marriage, created by Ulrandir, and had another child.
