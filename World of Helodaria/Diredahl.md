# Description
The Capital City of Sirkonos, Diredahl is a giant, low lying, multi textural city that has survived for a time longer than the current age. As old as Leerehalt Keep itself, Diredahl is said to have been founded almost 1300 years ago by some scholars, but it's true age is not known. The city is older than the [[Kingdom of Sirkonos]] itself.

The city proper is surrounded by a wall that reaches as high as 60 feet, hung well with royal banners and watched by [[Kronesguard]]. The city is layered, stretching higher in altitude the further West it stretches, as though it sprawled up a mountainous hill-scape to soak in the rising sun from the East. Dead in the centre, surrounded by a fortress of hard stone base and walls and iron, jutting out from the landscape likeÂ a dagger piercing a body, is [[Dun Murroc]], the great Spire of the West. An ancient tower and defensive bastion, and the site of the birth of the Sirkonian Royal lineage.

# Locations
The city is divided into districts: The Red district, the Blue district, the Sun district and the Moon district. The sources of their names are ancient and it is not truly known, and the divisions of the districts are not set in stone. If you were to live in Diredahl for a year, you might gain an understanding of where one begins and another ends, but no one will be able to guide you as to where the boundaries are.

- [[Don Murroc]], The Great Spire of the West. A great tower that site atop an iron-rose like fortress at the heart of the city, standing hundreds of feet tall and unbelievably well fortified. It is atop this great tower that the royal lineage of the Sirkon family found its crown, and the Kingdom of Sirkonos found its name.

## The Labyrinth Below
Below the city lies a labyrinth of old buildings and tunnels, remnants of the city's long forgotten heritage. The sewer system often intersects oddly with these old passageways, and few go deep into the labyrinth and survive.
