# Description
The Capital City of Sirkonos, Diredahl is a giant, low lying, multi textural city that has survived for a time longer than the current age. As old as Leerehalt Keep itself, Diredahl is said to have been founded almost 1500 years ago by some scholars, but it's true age is not known. The city is older than the [[Sirkonos]] itself.

The city proper is surrounded by a wall that reaches as high as 60 feet, hung well with royal banners and watched by [[Kronesguard]]. The city is layered, stretching higher in altitude the further West it stretches, as though it sprawled up a mountainous hillscape to soak in the rising sun from the East. Dead in the centre, surrounded by a fortress of hard stone base and walls and iron, jutting out from the landscape likeÂ a dagger piercing a body, is [[Dun Murroc]], the great Spire of the West. An ancient tower and defensive bastion, it is the birthplace of the Sirkonian Royal lineage. 
# History

# Notable Characters
- [[Woed]] #TODO 
- [[Count Drakus]] is the half-orc historical advisor to the crown, a notable historian in the region, and a patron of the arts. He sounds like the half orc guy who recruits the player to the dawnguard in Skyrim. 

# Locations
The city is divided into districts: The Red district, the Blue district, the Sun district and the Moon district. The sources of their names are ancient and it is not truly known, and the divisions of the districts are not set in stone. If you were to live in Diredahl for a year, you might gain an understanding of where one begins and another ends, but no one will be able to guide you as to where the boundaries are.

Geographically the districts are located as follows: **NW** is the Sun District, **SW** is the Moon district, **NE** is the Red and **SE** is the blue.


- [[Wooden Fang]], run by [[Woed]] the Blue Dragonborn
- [[Itchy Foot Inn]] inn, located near the estate of [[Count Drakus]]
- [[Manor Drakus]], home to [[Count Drakus]] who acts as a royal advisor on historical events and artifacts.

## The Red District

### Locations
- [[Don Murroc]], The Great Spire of the West. A great tower that site atop an iron-rose like fortress at the heart of the city, standing hundreds of feet tall and unbelievably well fortified. It is atop this great tower that the royal lineage of the Sirkon family found its crown, and the Kingdom of Sirkonos found its name.
## The Blue District
The geographically lowest are of Diredahl, the blue district is home to many taverns and bars, as well as various restaurants and theaters. The region is known for having many man made streams and aqueducts, as many of the water infrastructure of the surrounding city flows towards the blue district and out and East of the city. Notably, the sewerage of the city is dealt in such a way that it never travels far before being lost to the catacombs below. 

Small bridges and streams and wells populate the area and the sound of running water is never far. This part if the city also has some of the denser greenery due to the abundance of water.
### Locations
- **Fountainhead Plaza**. It is said that after the liberation of [[Dun Murroc]], the great fountain in this location flowed red with the blood of the demons that had been slayed by the first of the [[Kronesguard]], and the [[Battalion of the Red Fountain]] took its namesake from that symbol, the first of their captains dying their once white cloaks in the blood of the fountain.

## The Sun District
The highest part of the city, one of the stories of how the Sun District got its name was about how the first generals of the [[Kronesguard]] would walk to the apex of the hill overlooking Diredahl and feel the rays of the first dawn that the city had felt for years after the liberation of [[Dun Murroc]]. This history of this legend is tied to the [[Kronesguard]] legion that is tasked with the defense of Diredahl, the [[Battalion of the Red Fountain]].
- The **Twilight Manor** is a large, aristocratic inn with a large bath pool at the bottom featuring almost natural looking streams of hot water. The rooms are large suites with a separate sitting area.
## The Moon District

## The Labyrinth Below
Below the city lies a labyrinth of old buildings and tunnels, remnants of the city's long forgotten heritage. The sewer system often intersects oddly with these old passageways, and few go deep into the labyrinth and survive.
