## The Founding Einzberns
The group of knights that make up the seven founding members of the Einzberns made their home in a grand temple to [[Lathander]] and fortress during the [[History of Helodaria#The Age of Ascension|Age of Ascension]], [[Kenifria]]. Their binding of [[Athelstan]] required the sacrifice of their afterlife, and the corruption of their bloodlines. They stole holy light and bound it to their descendants - syphoning power to the Urd tree that binds Athelstan, and stealing power from him in turn.

- Syr [[Riemann Maine]]. Bald, tall, axe wearing human. Sirkonian, more gentle, deep voice but jolly and tries to bolster his friends.
- Syr [[Elizabeth Curte]]. Well built young woman with black hair and an ashy patch. British and proper sounding, but not proper in her mannerisms.
- Syr [[Lathran Murke]]. A wizard of long black hair with silver tips, the old Aasimar was responsible for the spell’s design that would allow the Vessel of Avarice to be used to imprison the fey that used it to ascend. He bears a wise tone and is a true devout follower of Lathander
- Syr [[Lorian Foltran]]. Short black hair and moustached human with serious tone. Strong and certain in his mannerisms
- Syr [[Tristan Renwillow]]. Golden locks and a light build wearing an ornate breastplate and a blade at his side. Happy but also serious when the time calls for it.
- Syr [[Jerrit Marlow]]. Dwarf of maul-wielding stature. He has extremely long black hair and a very well adorned beard. He has a tired air about how he speaks.
- Syr [[Siegfried Einzbern]]. Short, tamed hair. Middle age. Longsword at his back and armoured pauldrons atop hard leather fittings and chainmail and metal. His right pauldron is adorned with a wolf’s head insignia. He often also uses a maul in combat.
