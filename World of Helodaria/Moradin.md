He is a symbol of solidarity and strength among all dwarves, mountain especially. He is also the creator of the dwarf race, having forged their first ancestors within his great furnace and with his great hammer.

# Tenets and Teachings of Moradin
> - Ingenuity can solve any problem. Through community and strength, evil can be vanquished and your goals can be reached.
> - Do what you can for the betterment of your clan (community). Where you are a pillar for those around you, those around you are a fortress for you. Alone, be strong, but in unity you will find something far greater than strength.
> - Build monuments to who you are and who you have been, as you will not live forever. The longer you are remembered, the greater a life you must have lived.
