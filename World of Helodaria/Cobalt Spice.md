**Cobalt Spice** is an edible spice made by grinding up the wing carapace and wings of a light cobalt and gold beetle found in the [[Armoured Lands]]. Once the grinding is dried, the spice has a beautiful metallic sheen and a strangely bacon-like flavour, although eating too much may leave a bitter taste in the mouth for some time. 

[[Cobalt Spice]] can also be added to flour mixtures to give the bread a dark brown colour and a hard texture.
