###### Quick Reference
Mad lord of Rokbaur Castle. Sounds like Damian Darkblood.
# Description

**Malgus Kraber** is the first and only remaining son of [[Viscount Albert Straben]]. The man is a viscous, ruthless knight, tall and cruel. In secret, he murdered both his older sister and younger brother as a child, and his father hid the truth from the world. His mother committed suicide after the deaths of her two children, and Malgus became fascinated by the demonic histories of the land he would be warden of.

He grew, partially outside of his awareness, a connection and worship to the [[Demogorgon]].  The demon prince of madness would act like a second and third voice in his head throughout his life, until the day he murdered his father secretly and took his position as the warden of [[Rokbaur Castle]]

He has two sons, a highborn and a bastard.
