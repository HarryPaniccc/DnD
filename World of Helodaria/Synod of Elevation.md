The **Synod of Elevation** is a research facility belonging to a sect of [[Old Ruinan Empire]] mages loyal to [[The Malevolence]] dedicated to finding a way to access the source of magic, experimenting with people's souls. 

The Synod also had the objective of bringing out latent magical power in the children of sorcerers from the [[Old Ruinan Empire]] in order to give them a "last chance" to not dishonor their blood lines.
