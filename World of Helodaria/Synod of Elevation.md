The **Synod of Elevation** is a research facility belonging to a sect of [[Old Ruinan Empire]] mages loyal to [[The Malevolence]] dedicated to finding a way to access the source of magic, experimenting with people's souls. 

The Synod also had the objective of bringing out latent magical power in the children of sorcerers from the [[Old Ruinan Empire]] in order to give them a "last chance" to not dishonor their blood lines.

### Ceilings
Ceilings in the larger chambers are 60 ft. tall. In corridoors, hey are about 10 ft up - enough space for a floating highmage to get around without worrying about scraping his head.

### Arrival Chamber
The chamber in which the Nalfeshnee guard and the entrance portal are stored. Tiered with two levels, and a vastly high ceiling. The portal opens into an open chamber of stone, tiered, with what appears to be a balcony of sorts cut one layer. The ceiling of the central chamber is high, maybe 60 ft up. There are six pathways on the ground floor: Two left, two right, and two forward

### Residence Wing
A series of corridoors and rooms belonging to both ministers and those who had come to the synod for "Inauguration". Students have bars on their doors. There is a common room like space with a dining chamber. Bones litter the ground.
- **Secret Door** to the escape room on the first floor

##### Dining Chamber
The dining chamber is kept constantly clean as every hour, the **flameskulls** float in and tidy the place up. The room always falls back slowly into a state of horrible stench and grime, as the **wraiths** of two of the ministers of the Synod haunt this chamber.
### Escape Room
Ruined escape items are in this chamber.

### Research Wing
A long, austere hallway that wraps around a central scribing room where various scrolls and writings are conducted away from the noise of the rest of the Synod. 

The wing is connected to the library wing and the **chamber of reflection**.

In the bottom left corner of the research wing, second closest to the blocked door, the three pious **Flameskulls** have collected a small treasure trove of what, to them, represents things of value that their masters would have left behind that need protecting.

### Library Wing


### Emergence Chambers
From this wing the true purpose of the Synod is evident. Various rooms through which one might bring a student to "snap" towards their power.
##### Elemental Essence Chamber
Ornate shapes on the walls, depicting various different planes
Four pedistals, one broken, give of a faint light. On the floor, mosaic of the inner planes, depicting the elemental planes.

**Rylai feels a connection** to the three pedistals, and the shards on each of them
- Water shard is cold. Stillness. In it she finds dullness, the ability to hide from her pain, but also the loss of passion
- Fire shard is anguish. Power and frustration, but also love. Warmth. You realize just how familiar the feeling is, and how much you long for the cold to disipate, but also how much you fear it.
- Air shard you feel as you are. You feel a reflection of yourself. Less modified by your past or how you chose to deal with it, you feel in the air shard there is truth. It merely enhances the effects of the fire or water shards

Depending on what Rylai chooses, she will gain one of the following
- [[Elemental Essence Shard (Water)]]
- [[Elemental Essence Shard (Fire)]]
- [[Elemental Essence Shard (Air)]]

The two she did not choose will summon an elemental of each type, and two mephits of the combination of them.

## Second Level
### Vault of Emergence
On the left side, beneath the torture chambers
> Rooms filled with tables of smooth, light stone with depressions in them, cut seemingly so that a body can lie at the centers of them and be supported comfortably. At the center of the room, is what looks to be a slab of cobalt, polished flat on one side, and engraved in writings.

- Something like the corpse of an [[Mistborn Inquisitor Analogue]] guy
- Some kind of experiment on extracting the ability of people to use magic so that those born out of a sorcerer family.

### Chamber of Sacrifice
A chamber where those who fail to prove themselves capable of elevation are brought to the chamber of sacrifice, where they have a hideous ritual performed on their bodies and they are torn apart and transformed into a **Flameskull**.

### Knowing Fool
Mummy lord fight but themed like a man maddened by knowledge
