Young sort of lightly tanned human of short, dark curly hair. Son of [[Baron Owen Luthrand]] or [[Keldmire]].

He sounds quite pompous, like the berserk noble soldiers, but with German accent. He is kind, funny, and useful, if not demeaning of noble traditions. Gale is a commander of the [[Battalion of the Red Fountain]] of the [[Kronesguard]] in [[Diredahl]].
