Lord Alfred Gundrei is the human lord and sovereign of [[Dularen]] and a member of the [[Uldronos Council]] of the [[Republic of Ruina]].
# Description
The man is in his mid 30’s, with long, well kept black hair and a clean shaven face. His brown eyes command royalty and power. Assumed as one of the most powerful on the Council, he wears royal blue with white and black decorations. His actions in the council are to the interests of the Republic, even if it means harm to other sovereign powers or to the lower classes of his own republic.

His guard force is often seen as his own personal army, and is identifiable by the heavy chainmail and face-concealing steel helmets that they wear. [[Castle Gundrei]] is found in the outskirts of  [[Dularen]], at the Outer-Manor fields to the south. His house symbol is a deer in profile, and his colours are dark deep, midnight blue and lighter blue.

Should the empire go to war, the armies of the empire will all fall under a single control and he will be in charge of controlling them.
