# Description
Steinwalde, the forest of stone, was a grand and secret dwarven city hidden deep within the mountains of the [[Maghlas Mountains|Maghlas Mountain Range]]. For many thousands of years, [[Dwarf]] culture has thrived there, as wealth and industry and innovation foulrished.

A centre for craftsmanship, Steinwalde was home to many dwarven clans, all of which harbouring a healthy spirit of competition with one another. The grand halls and sections of the tunnel-city are home to countless artisans and markets.

Steinwalde is not hidden due to a desire for solitude, but rather because of its remoteness. To access Steinwalde, travellers must brave an extreme pilgrimmage through the Maghlas Mountains north of [[Sirkonos]], contending with Dragons and Giants.

# Locations

### Outer Fortifications
Long stone road leading through many large statues and battlements cut square in the rockface of the surrounding crags. The fortifications span multiple smaller fortresses surrounding the Entryhall and its grander gates.
### Entryhall
A long highway stretching along the face of the southern mountain, decorated by hundreds of series grand arches. Theree grand, primary entrance doors miles away from one another connect the Entryhall to the outside world, and act as the primary highways to the surrounding southern [[Maghlas Mountains]] ranges. The entryhall stretches from south west to north east, with the largest of the gates at the centre of it.

- **Khaldron's Gate** is the largest and most central of the three entrances, a massive set of stone doors cut into the mountain, flanked by a ring of fortresses joined by walls and guarded constantly.
- **Morinan's Gate** is the southemost of the entryhall's entrances, and has remained undiscovered for thousands of years. In contrast to the other gates, whose locations are known by the enemies of Steinwalde, and thus are more proud and loud in their fortifications, Morinan's Gate hides invisibly in the stonework of the mountains.
- **[[Zundulkhar]], the Molten Hall** is the northmost fortress and gate to the entryhall, and was lost centuries ago to the forces of the [[Duvan'ahr the Sleeping Odium|Bane of Steinwalde]].
### The Stone Forest
A large, cavernous hallway with massive stalagmite pillars that have joined the ceiling and floor of the cavern millenia ago. Many of these pillars have been carved into and connected with stone bridges, creating a winding network of buildings, shops, residences and neighbourhoods.
