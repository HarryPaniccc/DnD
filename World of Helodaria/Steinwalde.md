# Description
Steinwalde, the forest of stone, is a grand and secret dwarven city hidden deep within the mountains of the [[Maghlas Mountains|Maghlas Mountain Range]]. For many thousands of years, [[Dwarf]] culture has thrived there, as wealth and industry and innovation foulrished.

A centre for craftsmanship, Steinwalde was home to many dwarven clans, all of which harbouring a healthy spirit of competition with one another. The grand halls and sections of the tunnel-city are home to countless artisans and markets.

Steinwalde is not hidden due to a desire for solitude, but rather because of its remoteness. To access Steinwalde, travellers must brave an extreme pilgrimmage through the Maghlas Mountains north of [[Sirkonos]], contending with Dragons and Giants.

# History
Sometime during the [[Age of Ascension]], the city was founded by [[Urthir Stonehand]] as a refuge and fortress. At some point during [[The Fall]] it became a safe haven, its inhabitants concealing themselves from the wars above and focussing on only themselves.

### The [[Flamebrands]]
A battalion of soldiers known particularly for their red dragon hunting tactics. Many bear scars, often their armour is molded to show them off as marks of pride, where it is practical. They always carry [[Potion of Fire Resistance|potions of fire resistance]], as well as thick armours, heavy crossbows made to bring down their prey, and bridges so that they might span gaps near where their hunt is.

They field roughly four hundred warriors in total, with hunting parties being dispatched in the dozens by Gaz, or fighting as a unit.

**Members**
- [[Gaz the Branded]] - A scarred dwarf and the leader of the [[Flamebrands]].
- [[Borthi son of Tingor]] - A cleric follower of Moradin and second in command to Gaz.

### Steinwaldie Guard
Steinwalde's military guard consists of soldiers from many contesting houses all allied under the king's banner. At any one time, roughly two thousand soldiers are armed and actively patrol the city and the entryhall. Four thousand can be martialled to defend the city should they need greater numbers, and in dire circumstances, conscriptions can reach around ten thousand should they need the men.
# Locations

>[!Important] Visible Regions
> From the entryhall there is a long, grand cavernous hallway which leads to Steinwalde proper. From there a grand bridge connects a huge balcony to a rockface populated with homes and buildings. On either side, stairs lead down to a lower level, and up to a series of multiple levels of balconies and pathways suspended by chains. Spiral staircases are cut into great pillars allowing passageway between the levels, and grand stairways are cut into the sides of the mountain.
## Outer Fortifications
Long stone road leading through many large statues and battlements cut square in the rockface of the surrounding crags. The fortifications span multiple smaller fortresses surrounding the Entryhall and its grander gates.
## Entryhall
A long highway stretching along the face of the southern mountain, decorated by hundreds of series grand arches. Three grand, primary entrance fortresses miles away from one another connect the Entryhall to the outside world, and act as the primary highways to the surrounding southern [[Maghlas Mountains]] ranges. The entryhall stretches from south west to north east, with the largest of the gates at the centre of it.

It is well guarded, patrols marching up and down in groups of 20 often for days at a time.
### Outer Fortresses
[[Infernoguard Tower|Infernoguard Towers]] have been used in the last few months to reinforce the defences around the entryhall gates — the first of them being used to reinforce **Khaldron's Gate**.

- **Khaldron's Gate** is the largest and most central of the three entrances, a massive set of stone doors cut into the mountain, flanked by a ring of fortresses joined by walls and guarded constantly.
- **Morinan's Gate** is the southemost of the entryhall's entrances, and has remained undiscovered for thousands of years. In contrast to the other gates, whose locations are known by the enemies of Steinwalde, and thus are more proud and loud in their fortifications, Morinan's Gate hides invisibly in the stonework of the mountains.
- **[[Zundulkhar]], the Molten Hall** is the northmost fortress and gate to the entryhall, and was lost centuries ago to the forces of the [[Duvan'ahr the Sleeping Odium|Bane of Steinwalde]].
### Oldhall
The oldhall is a large, cavernous hallway that the entryhall leads into. It was the first of the central halls of [[Steinwalde]] in the ages past, and is now barracks for the forward soldiers of [[King Dharn the Blacklock]]'s armies, as well as home to a number of traders, shops and inns for anyone who manages to make the trek from the surrounding villages or dwarven fortifications.

A tiered series of stairs and ramps for carts stretches some hundred meters down the hallway. At each landing tier, hallways snake out into the mountainside. A **grand statue** in the likeness of an [[Infernoguard Tower]] sits at the back of the hallway, flanked by 10 titanic pillars.

- **Barracks** lie to the left of the entrance.
- **Forges, glassblowers, woodworkers and bars** all stretch along the left walkway
- **Banker and gold exchangers** can be found
- **A small market** stretches like roots beneath the grand statue in the back of the region, growing around 2 of the 10 pillars.

## The Stone Forest
An incredible network of strata-laced caverns formed from grand stalagmite pillars joining ceiling and floor, the Stone forest looks almost as a series of hills that grow wider as they reach the solid sky. Many of these pillars have been carved into and connected with stone bridges, creating a winding network of buildings, shops, and residences.

Rocky crags and sharp pathway lace the ground floor of the region which rises and falls throughout the city.

From the balcony-like landing of the exit of the [[#Oldhall]] one can take a bridge to a central platform built into huge pillar that has been turned into castle of sorts with multiple layers and purposes.

>[!Important] Directions
>It is important to note that one is facing North when one enters through the [[#Oldhall]].
### General Locations
- **Barracks** for the soldiers on standby exist as a tiered series of rooms cut into the Southwest walls, overhanging as a series of balconies which each extend further than the last. **Usually one thousand troops are available at one time, mostly spread through the city, while another six hundred usually guard the entryhall and its surroundings.** Should the city need, it can field four thousand troops, or, in dire circumstances, closer to ten thousand can be called on.
- **Watercourse Market** is a large marketplace stretching along the North Eastern floor of the Stone forest, some distance underneath the main level walkways. It sits next to a natural underground lake with various rivers and streams leading into the mineral rich water.
- **Huntsman's Halls** are a series of wooden hallways that stick out like a thumb against the northmost side of the mountain. Well known as the chief providers of game for the city, they often send hunters out north of the city and to the mountain on which it was built.
- **Feast Halls** are common in steinwalde, and on of the greatest of them is the [[Dragonbone Feasthall]], a large hall where an adult white dragon's skeleton is suspended overhead.
### Forge Throne
- Wyrmthrone Hall is the main hall in the building.
At the heart of the city, where the magma runs thick and hot, the forgethrone sits above the greatforges. Here, the king of Steinwalde holds his council. Grand bridges built into what was an even grander mine with huge statues of dwarves surrounded by sharp rocks stand watch, surrounded by balconies aplenty.

### Hall of Carved Memories
> We write our histories in stone. That which is not set in stone or metal can be changed. That which is changed is forgotten. That which is not forgotten, strengthens us.

A grand network of passageways lined with books, stretching outwards from a central pillar in a circular motion, the hall of carved memories has a great share of books and histories carved in stone tablets and murals and paintings. It is watched in chief by [[Elmsier the Keeper]].
## The Crucible
Where [[Thran the Anvil]] trains the greatest of soldiers. Pits of fine gravel and floors heated greatly.

## The Greatforges
![[Pasted image 20260104200221.png|right|500]]
Big forge and lots of lava tf you want from me. Outside is a great number of titanically scaled forges where hundreds of dwarves toil day in and day out in metal working.

### [[Steinwalde Heart-Kiln]]
The [[Steinwalde Heart-Kiln]] is located here. The greatest of the ancient forges of the dwarves of Eranulaid, the mechanical marvels of the chamber allow for the flowing of immense heat into the chamber. The entryway depicts massive doors lined with jewels and masterfully cut stone and steel and gold elements

A balcony sits over a great pool of lava, accessible through various chains and mechanisms above. Above, a grand statue of [[Moradin]] stretches his hand outwards, hammer leveled over the standing platform. 

Here, [[Lathran, Avatar of Lathander|Lathran]] and [[Grelchar the Keen]] toil on new creations.

## Eternal Mines
The wealth of Steinwalde is in its unbelievable richness of the stones.
## Fungal Glade
A vast network of fungas covered caverns, the shallower of which are often foraged in for the city people.
