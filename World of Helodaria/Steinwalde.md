# Description
Steinwalde, the forest of stone, was a grand and secret dwarven city hidden deep within the mountains of the [[Maghlas Mountains|Maghlas Mountain Range]]. For many thousands of years, [[Dwarf]] culture has thrived there, as wealth and industry and innovation foulrished.

A centre for craftsmanship, Steinwalde was home to many dwarven clans, all of which harbouring a healthy spirit of competition with one another. The grand halls and sections of the tunnel-city are home to countless artisans and markets.

Steinwalde is not hidden due to a desire for solitude, but rather because of its remoteness. To access Steinwalde, travellers must brave an extreme pilgrimmage through the Maghlas Mountains north of [[Sirkonos]], contending with Dragons and Giants.
