# Description

The small mire-town of Fengate is located at the base of [[Banespear Mountain]]. The gentle swamps made for comfortable living conditions for a small group of farmers, but it only saw growth after a vein of tin and silver was found around 730 PF. Since then the village has seen a strong mining export.

The surrounding mire is mostly only travelable on the main roads with any form of efficiency, and a small forest surrounds the village.
