#TODO Read all this shit and rework the order of things. Maybe have an "Eras" document and a timeline too?



Helodaria has existed for many thousands of years, the ages being divided into distinct periods: The Eternity of Before, The Unknowable Age, The Age of Ascension, The Fall, and The Modern Age.
# The Eternity of Before
---
Once, before history was even a concept and memory was not defined, the planes were young and the first entities were still finding their permanent forms. The multiverse was a primal amalgamation of chaos, a vast ocean of elemental energy. This was the world that was ruled by the aboleths. They forged their empire, and ruled over the beginnings of life with an iron fist, over an eternal abyss of waters and emptiness and chaos.

When the [[Deities of Helodaria]] arrived in the material plane, the aboleths were driven to defeat by the divine power that had entered the realm, and their hold of the planes was lost. They were imprisoned before the cementing of the mortal races, and their hunger for revenge has never subsided.
# The Unknowable Age
---
The Gods, forms of power and ambition that saw the toiling chaos of the realms as inspiration and potential for beauty and expression, found themselves within the interplanar space that was yet to be Helodaria. This is the beginning of history, and the true start to the world of Helodaria. The first age, the first day, had arrived. 

Primordial elemental chaos was all there was where the Material now is. The four prime elemental planes had begun their convergence, in a great display of pure chaos and entropy. The Gods saw this as beauty, as potential, and began to enforce their own wills upon the unformed multiverse, halting the elemental convergence, and creating the [[Material Plane]] where the four [[Elemental Planes]] had started to intersect, sectioning the Materium away from the elemental chaos, and enforcing a great order over the multiverse.

For a time the Gods' creations flourished. They wove and forged and sang the first peoples into existence, and those people looked up at their creators and worshipped them. The magic and name of the Weave of magic was born, and it was felt and woven and tangled by the peoples of Helodaria to master their surroundings, in conjunction with the divine gifts of their creators.
## [[Dawn War]]
During this age before ages, the great elemental [[Primordials]] made themselves known to be the enemies of the gods and their creations. As the realms were under creation, the Primordials of fundamental concepts grew wrathful, and unleashed terrible destruction on the young peoples of Helodaria: Shattering their forms, setting forth unknowable cosmic powers, and calling upon the chaos of the [[Abyss]] to feed upon the children of the Gods. 

The Gods waged great war on the elemental titans, whose very power had gained a collective of worshipping of various beings from across the planes. In this time, true evil found its way into the hearts of mortals for the first time. The violent ambition that the Gods could fall to ruin. That the creators could be undone. [[Dawn War]] saw death and destruction shatter the multiverse. The conflict of the Primordials and the Gods shook the very cosmos, and even after it was won, the destruction that it had wrought could be felt across the planes.
# The [[Age of Ascension]]
---
Magic, divine and arcane, was a gift from the gods in the form of lessons. Temples were constructed, wars were waged and, eventually, empires were formed, and the worlds and planes truly settled once again. Some would use these powers to enact the age of ascension. Others would see their newfound gifts as evidence that they were the new Gods of the world, and would attempt to rule over mortals like tyrants.

With the races having founded their homesteads and grasped their magics, empires grew and fell. Dwarves forged great underground fortresses, filled with treasure, monetary and arcane. Elves came into their magical attunement and wove great cities from the landscape itself, and humanity founded empires that grew and conquered. Kingdoms were forged throughout the world with materials terrestrial and foreign to the plane, and the material plane grew to the height of its power.

The Gods sanctified their power and worship through feats and creations, aiding in the construction of grand monuments and giving guidance to those who headed their first, greatest temples. Technology and magic was becoming more powerful, to the point where weapons were made that let those without the spark of the arcane in their blood challenge even the most powerful sorcerers.

During the height of the Ascension mortals forged grand magical items, weapons and tools that gave the wielders exceptional abilities. Many of these items were used by champions of gods and mortals alike, and they were used to unify and lead, or to sunder and oppress. The age of ascension was an era of experimentation of the limits, and the breaking thereof, of mortal capability. During this time, the limits of the arcane were tested and subverted and put to direct competition with the abilities of the divine.
### Ambitions of the Arcane
The powerful mages across the world of Helodaria began to truly test the limits of their abilities. Cities that could shift in and out of planes on command, immensely powerful weapons that harnessed the elements, magic was being stretched to its limit.

Golems were constructed by intelligent mages that wanted to see if they could mimic the Gods’ ability to create life and through experiments with Chimeras, Leonen and Tabaxi were created. Demiplanes were forged and empires rose, conquered, and fell.

#TODO Fill out a lot of events that happened in the Fall and Age of Ascension (Athelstan, Einzberns, etc.)
## [[The Fall]]

Very little is certain regarding the events of the Fall. No one is certain how long it lasted, but no one born before the beginning of it saw its end. No one knows how it started, but the events of the war between the gods and their followers is still remembered to this day. 

The end of The Fall occurred circa 800 years before the time of the Vanguard.
