# Description
As what many believe to be the center of the center of [[Ruina]], Midvale has developed with a little bit of everything from its neighbouring towns. A snazzy village of culture and hospitality, the somewhat small Midvale has open streets and many storage barns for trading guilds looking to have even distribution for their wares. Unfortunately this has attracted bandits to a few of the roads, but the guard’s presence is felt heavily here in order to relieve the strain, in addition to housing legions of [[Boreal Conclave]].

The town is designed on the [[Eithval River]] with the intersection of the river and the [[Platinum Highroad]] guiding its shape. Surrounding it is a greatly diverse biosystem, with forests and fields and mountains. The roads are dirt and often muddy as thoroughfare is common.

The quality of life here has never been bad, as the merchants traveling from [[Dularen]] and the artisans and traders traveling from [[Vasspryg]] have always brought with them a bit of wealth and an inflation of the economy in Midvale. 

Midvale is, however, in no way dependent on her neighbours. The primary source of food for Midvale is the [[Eithval River]], its richness in fish and diversity make for easy fishing, as its volcano-fed ecosystem thrives year-round. The river comes from the mountains west of Ashfort, and is thus enriched with minerals. The most common fish found is tuna, but larger, more dangerous species have been known to roam the waters. 

Boar frequents this large area, and if often hunted by the townspeople. Not too many live in the village, as most who visit Midvale are just stopping a day or two for rest.  Traders often pass through the village, so lots of goods are available year round.

## Flooded Caverns

Under Midvale exists a small network of caves formed from the river leading south. These caverns can be easily accessed by the well in the middle of the town.

The caverns are often filled with knee-high water, but throughout the phases of the tides the water will rise and lower. The walls are sleek stone and algae covered.

The caverns lead quite far south to a small tribe of crocodile-like lizardfolk. The tribe is accessible from caves in the forest south of Midvale. These lizardfolk are generally peaceful, but have come into conflict with Ragnus and his agenda.
