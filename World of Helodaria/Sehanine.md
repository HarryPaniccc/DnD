**Sehanine, the Moonsong** is the Elven God of love, freedom, and the Moon. She embodies creativity and expression. She is one of the [[Creation Gods]] of the [[Deities of Helodaria]].
# Details
---
Sehanine is often found within the plane of [[Arborea]] or wandering the [[Feywild]]. She is as nomadic as the moon she urged into existence, with her moods shifting as the phases.
## Titles
- The Moon Song
- The Moon Heart
- The Lady of Dreams
## Appearance
When personified, Sehanine appears most often as a short, youthful elven woman wearing a gown or robe woven in true silver, [[Mirthral]], or moonlight. Shadows and light reflect and play with the edges of her form and her hair, which is long - often the most consistent element of any of her forms.

Her avatar shapes, however, are as varied as the phases of the moon. Her appearance changes often, sometimes wielding an elven blade or bow, sometimes wearing beautiful armour that blinds her enemies, and sometimes she is adorned with nothing other than a brooch embossed with a crescent shape.
