The Isaura are an isolated community in [[Zitrumea]] with elvish roots consisting of primarily elves as well as a mix of a few other races. They are one of the last remaining origins of elven kind, their sister nation of [[Qel-Annura]] acting as the other great origin of modern elven kind, though they play a more interactive role in the world around them.

Their home is an elven city of the same name found in a mountainous forest near the northern border of [[Republic of Pyleas|Pyleas]]. Isaura is by no means an urban nation, the houses and even the large structures are shaped from stone and grown from the roots of the earth.  
# Culture
They are led by the High Vizier, a wise and usually powerful individual, tasked with keeping his people and the natural balance of the world safe.
