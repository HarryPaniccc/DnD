One of the [[Elemental Planes]] of the [[Planes of Existence]], the Elemental Plane of Air is a realm of endless skies, clouds, and winds. It connects to the [[Material Plane]] to [[Helodaria]].

>"The essentual nature of air is movement, animation, and inspiration. Air is the breath of life, the winds of change, the fresh breeze that clears away the fog of ignorance and the stuffiness of old ideas."

# Portals to the [[Material Plane]]
Portals to the plane of air can be found in regions of extreme height or tempestuous power.
### Portal to the [[Temple of Elemental Evil]]
At the [[Ley Nexus]] where four [[Ley Lines]] of the elements converge in [[Ruina]] the [[Temple of Elemental Evil]] was built. Some time during or before early [[Age of Ascension]] the temple was sealed by followers of [[Lathander]]. The four elemental portals within became exclusively entrances for the denizens of the temple, being unable to leave.
