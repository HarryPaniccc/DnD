**Estravia** is a small province of villages situated to the north of [[Sirkonos]], nestled in the highlands of the [[Maghlas Mountains]]. Owing fealty to the Sirkonian crown, they are recognised as belonging to the kingdom, but have little interaction with the lowland region.

- Dot at the bottom is the destroyed [[Redvalley]]
- Dot above that is [[Valeria]]'s supposed location. In truth it is in the tight valley southwest of that point, a bit of subtrefuge for safety's sake in case a roaming force decides to attack them.
# History

# Geography
Mostly hard kept, tight roads. Perilous and rocky. Think the Romanian scenery from Nosferatu. The villages of Estravia are superstitious and scattered, small little settlements, mostly unnamed and a few hours away from one another.

- [[Valeria]] - The largest Estravian village in the middle of a deep valley, surrounded on all sides by mountain and adjacent to a frigid river.
- [[Redvalley]] - a small village about an hour south of [[Valeria]]. Destroyed in 813 PF.
- [[Trau's End]] - a village at the end of the valley north of [[Valeria]] overlooking the central hills of the region.
### Landmarks
- [[Yiata River]] is the large frigid river that winds through the region.
