**Estravia** is a small province of villages situated to the north of [[Sirkonos]], nestled in the highlands of the [[Maghlas Mountains]]. Owing fealty to the Sirkonian crown, they are recognised as belonging to the kingdom, but have little interaction with the lowland region.

# History

# Geography
Mostly hard kept, tight roads. Perilous and rocky. Think the Romanian scenery from Nosferatu. The villages of Estravia are superstitious and scattered, small little settlements, mostly unnamed and a few hours away from one another.

- [[Valeria]] - The largest Estravian village in the middle of a deep valley, surrounded on all sides by mountain and adjacent to a frigid river.
