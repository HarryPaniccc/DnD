# Description
### History
The history of King Sirkon is tied heavily to the history of [[Desseran]], [[Thay]], [[Sirkonos]], the [[Heart of the Abyss]], and of [[Eranulaid History|Eranulaid]] itself. Born a man of [[Desseran]], Sirkon fought during the [[The Fall]] against the forces of [[Malar]] and the [[Abyss]] that had ravaged the realm where [[Sirkonos]] now sits. During the greatest battle of [[Diredahl]], he led the people of the city into [[Dun Murroc]] where, under his command, the hordes were pushed back and the first great liberation of Sirkonos took place. The people of the realm named him king, and named the realm after him.

During this time [[Desseran]] was under [[Thay|Thayan]] control. #TODO

Afterwards he would grow to corrupt the leadership of [[Thay]] to his control, promising the gift of eternal life to those who pledged themselves to his service.
