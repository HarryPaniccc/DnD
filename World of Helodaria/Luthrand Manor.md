The estate is guarded by men in light armour and surrounded by a low wall. Beautifully kept, the large manor of [[House Luthrand]] has a courtyard in the front clearly designed to receive carriages and guests while also remaining an operational challenge for anyone looking to steal from the Baron. Men with long blades at their sides nod to Tevis as he leads the two of you to a steward who receives your horses as another two exit the structure and help with your luggage and things.

There is a guesthouse off to the left connected by a roofed walkway to the main estate
