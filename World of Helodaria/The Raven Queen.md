*The Raven Queen's true name is Nerava(?)*

The Raven Queen is one of the deities in the pantheon of the [[Founding Gods]]. She is the God of death and Fate, her domain encompasses those whose lives are ending or have come to an end, and she is the patron to those who would seek to destroy undead creatures. 
# Details

Residing in the [[Fortress of Memories]] within the [[Shadowfell]], the Raven Queen tends to and protects the souls of the departed. She collects other, interesting things that represent personality, such as memories, things that bring her once-shattered mind comfort. She holds dominion over souls and death, and is worshipped by those who have lost someone or wish for serenity that comes with less attachment. Her association with death and the conclusion of life often leads people to have a stigma against her.

Her [[Fortress of Memories]] is a place of solemnness, containing countless memories that have been taken into her care. She believes that souls should be cared for after death, and that as your life ends you should be given the rest that you deserve. Her goals are to collect essence and memories of these souls, also collecting other trinkets from throughout the multiverse, all of them held and carefully tended to by her ravens. This is not to gain power, but is rather an almost childish fascination, and desire to protect and care for them.

The Raven Queen despises undeath, and because of that she has a fierce hatred of [[Orcus]] the Demon Lord of Undeath.

## Appearance
The Raven Queen is a more abstract being than the other gods, appearing often as a collection of ravens or as signs. Her true form is that of a young, dark haired woman wearing shadows as gothic garments. Underneath her usual, expressionless mask she is quite beautiful.
## Birth of the Raven Queen
During the Fall, a powerful Elven Sorceress Queen, in an attempt to unite the houses of her people and the gods that ruled over them, began rituals in an attempt to elevate herself to godhood. A group of zealots, wanting to take her new divine power for themselves, interrupted the last of these rituals, transporting all present, the Sorceress, her devout followers, and themselves to the [[Shadowfell]]. The now-Goddess, in the confusion and pain of her shattered mind, clutched to her existence with all of her power, and almost forgot all of who she was. Thus, the Raven Queen was born. The other gods, viewing this act as a potential threat to their power, destroyed the means for this ritual to be repeated, and banished the memory of the Queenâ€™s true name from all mortal minds and history.
## Relationships
### [[Orcus]]

# Tenets and Teachings

>[!Tenets]
> - The natural progression of all life is death the soul to peacefully move on. To hold on to your soul unnaturally is perverse and evil.
> - Undeath is a plague on this world. Destroy these malformations so that their souls may find peace, should they deserve it.
> - Love those nearing the end of their lives. Do not be sorrowful, for their soul will be tended to in its transition from life.
