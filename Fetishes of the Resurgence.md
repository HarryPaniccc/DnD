The **Divine Fetishes of the Resurgence** are holy relics wielded by the avatars of the [[Deities of Helodaria|Deities]] of the [[Desseran Apostolate]]. These legendary items were weapons used by the god kings during [[The Fall]], and would become the symbols of worship of the Desseran Apostolate

- [[Divine Fetish of the Avatar of the Bahamut]]
- [[Divine Fetish of the Avatar of the Raven Queen]]
- [[Divine Fetish of the Avatar of Lathander]]

I would like one of them to be a circlet, kinda like cosmic drive from league or something like it. Maybe one is made from the claws of a great ancient dragon that was slain by the bahamut avatar.
