**Previous Session:** [[Session 84 - Travel to Steinwalde]]
**Subsequent Session:**
## Introduction

> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Kanan Einzbern]] and [[Caede]] have begin their journey through the province of [[Estravia]] in the [[Maghlas Mountains]] north of [[Sirkonos]], joined by their regional guide, the legendary vampire hunter [[Rudolph van Richten]].
- Now, a week into their travels, the group has rescued a man from the curse of lycanthropy, having a run in with his previous captors, what appeared to be a group of brigands run led by a man who identified himself as [[Ballard]]
- 
### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the 25th of *Antumbrahn*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).

# [[Valeria]] Ranging
---
### View from the Apex
[[Syr Edmund]] will lead the party to a high ground overlooking [[Valeria]], it takes about an hour to climb the well-trodden path, but it is well worth the view.

- The path is marked by various shrines to spirits of the mountains and to [[Ilmater]].
- [[Valeria]] sits **South** of the path, a well established village, shielded by much of what they might fear. Further south is the slight burning embers of the destroyed village to the south: [[Redvalley]]
- To the **East** of Valeria there winds an incredibly lazy but wide river of frigid looking waters. This is the central river, [[Yiata River]], and its waters flow through the entirety of Estravia.

Slightly further up there sits a flat upon which a simple cabin is built, used by scouts to watch for dangers. Two hunters nod to the group as they approach.

- From here, the altitude north of valeria varies slowly going northwards. Small villages, close together, dot the land.
- A valley leads **North** , through which a small tributary of the [[Yiata River]] flows. There is a good path in that direction. An easy journey to the end of the valley
- The skull marks the home of [[Lord Harrenhal]]

### Travel Random Encounters
- Every hour or two they pass through another small hamlet. Edmund will speak with the people there who approach them, otherwise waving to them.
- As the days go by the party encounters more and more landmarks
# The Faults
---
In order for the group to further their trek northwards they will need to surpass the large barrier that is the section of the [[Yiata River]] river that cuts the Estravian region off from the mountains to Steinwalde.

Shattered plains
- HORDE of ghouls and ghoul craver minions
- Bheur Hag has her hidden lair down here


# Warcry of the [[Flamebrands]]
---
[[Gaz the Branded]] and his soldiers battle a young and an adult red dragon

> The sounds of... singing of some kind echo through the valley. A war chant, slow, simple. But captivating, then, from over the ridge, a streak of vibrant crimson blows, trailing ember and smoke. Cutting the sky with a roar like thunder. A lean body of muscle, unscarred, a beautiful, vibrant red the likes of which you're unsure you've seen before, and rows of teeth. 
> 
> Not to mention the fire trailing from its mouth.

They have a war priest and a bunch of warrior veterans and a mage
