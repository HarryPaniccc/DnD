## Introduction

> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Kanan Einzbern]] and [[Caede]] have begin their journey through the province of [[Estravia]] in the [[Maghlas Mountains]] north of [[Sirkonos]], joined by their regional guide, the legendary vampire hunter [[Rudolph van Richten]].
- Now, a week into their travels, the group has rescued a man from the curse of lycanthropy, having a run in with his previous captors, what appeared to be a group of brigands run led by a man who identified himself as [[Ballard]]
- 
### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the 25th of *Antumbrahn*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).
