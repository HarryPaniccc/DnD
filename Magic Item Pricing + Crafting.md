Item values need to be somewhat more consistent.
# Crafting
Crafting and item by DMG rules and Xanathars takes incredibly long. The sell price of an item is roughly double that of the crafting cost. The crafting time in the DMG gives 25gp per day increment, which is ridiculously slow. *The idea is to quarter or eighth the crafting time.*

In order to craft an item, each 100gp of its **crafting cost** requires one day of work. Depending on the level, hiring a very skillful helper to aid in crafting at maybe 25gp per day can increase the productivity.

>[!Example]
>For example, Silb's Dwarven Plate was commissioned at 40 000gp selling price. This puts its crafting price probably around the 20k - 25k gp, or, at best when working solo, 200 days of forging.
>
>Due to the number of skilled smiths aiding in the process, and the speciality of the forge, it makes sense to assign a large number of people working on the item, so if 5 dwarves worked on the armor, the work would take 40 days to complete $20000 \div 5 = 40$
