Item values need to be somewhat more consistent.

## Item Process
# Pricing
## DMG Pricing Table
- 25 Gp is a day for crafting in DMG
- 50 Gp per **WORK WEEK** (5 days) in Xanathar's, which is nonsense I think. Crafting cost is half selling cost, so if a sword sells for 200 Gp, it takes 2 days to craft
- Xanathar's has a magic item ingredients table: Item rarity connected to component CR
	- Therefore a behir pearl can make a RARE item as it is CR 11
- Theres also a brewing potion of healing section in Xanathar's

| Rarity    | Character Level | Value           |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Common    | 1st or higher   | 50-100 gp       |
| Uncommon  | 1st or higher   | 100-500 gp      |
| Rare      | 5th or higher   | 501-5,000 gp    |
| Very rare | 11th or higher  | 5,001-50,000 gp |
| Legendary | 17th or higher  | 50,001+ gp      |
|           |                 |                 |
## Values in game
Calculate based on rarity, amount of uses, half modifier for single-use items, and for utility and power. Different locations have different values.
