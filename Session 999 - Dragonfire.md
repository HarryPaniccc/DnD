## Introduction
> "This is the legend of the Vanguard" or some kind of blurb. MAYBE do sequential lyrics to the sun the moon the stars or something.
> 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

# Warcry of the [[Flamebrands]]
---
> The sounds of... singing of some kind echo through the valley. A war chant, slow, simple. But then from over the ridge, a streak of vibrant crimson flows, trailing ember and smoke. Cutting the sky with a roar like thunder. A lean body of muscle, unscarred, a beautiful, vibrant red the likes of which you're unsure you've seen before, and rows of teeth. 
> 
> Not to mention the fire trailing from its mouth.

On a plateau covered in snow in a clearing within a small forest of fir trees [[Gaz the Branded]] and his [[Flamebrands]] have set a trap in order to trap the [[Young Red Dragon]] [[Bloodmaw]]. What Gaz is hoping for, and what he has not yet told his soldiers, is that he hopes this will draw out [[Oriothar the Monarch]].
##### **Encounter** - Young Red Dragon and [[Oriothar the Monarch|Old Whitehorn]]
**Oriothar** has 768 hit points, as well as greatwyrm scales -2 per damage instance, and the **young red dragon** has 445 hit points, or 534 if its going too fast.

If the battle begins to go south, Oriothar will realize that the obsession that [[Gaz the Branded|Gaz]] has with him will lead to more deaths than he can inflict here, so he will allow the dwarf to survive. Worst case scenario, Oriothar will flee with his life.

**Initiatives:**
- [[Gaz the Branded]], statblock of Thwad Underbrew modified
- [[Borthi son of Tingor]], War priest will play a supportive role with spells like Crusader's Mantle and hold monster
- 9 x [[Flamebrands Statblock|Flamebrands]] Are the grunts 
- Young red dragon
- [[Oriothar the Monarch|Old Whitehorn]]
- Van Richten - Protect the horses
