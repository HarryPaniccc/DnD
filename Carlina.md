# Description
**Carlina** is a small village in the kingdom of [[Sirkonos]] some 15 miles east along the main road outside of [[Keldmire]]. The village is a popular stopping point along the main road, and so its Inn is often well stocked and comfortable.

The village is surrounded by a low wall of wood. The main road runs parallel to the front wall, and the front gate is kept shut between sunset and sunrise. The sheriff's men are well funded and about one in every five wield a musket owned by the Baron.
