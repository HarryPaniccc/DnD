# Gunslinger Traits

### Level 3
---
#### Firearm Proficiency
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms.
#### Gambit of Preference
Gambits represent the stylish tricks that Gunslingers are capable of performing with their weapons. When you gain the Gunslinger archetype, you learn one Gambit of your choice. You can swap out this Gambit when you level up. You can only use a gambit's active effect once per turn.

Once you use this feature up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you must finish a short or long rest to use a Gambit again. 

The DC associated with your Gunslinger Gambits is calculated as follows: $$\text{Gambit DC} =8 + \text{your proficiency bonus} + \text{your Intelligence or Dexterity mod (your choice)}$$
##### Special Powders
Some gambits allow you the creation of unique blends of the black powder that is used in firearms. These are denoted as Powders in their names and follow the following rule conventions.

> You learn to create a limited amount of a unique blend of black powder. When you reload a firearm you may choose to load a round with this special powder into the firearm. It uses your ammunition as normal, but you remembered to modify this round before the battle.
> 
> If your firearm can hold multiple rounds, you must declare the order in which the special rounds are loaded. Once fired, the round gains additional effects based on the type of special powder you have crafted.

#### Gunslinger Calibre
Hard hitting artillerists, bombastic outlaws, and crafty scoundrels are all unique embodiments of what a gunslinger means - whether that be aggressive mobility, reliance on firepower, or supplementing already lethal weaponry with the force of black powder. Choose one of the following Calibres, which best suites your character's playstyle. You can swap out your Calibre when you level up.

##### Artillerist
"Run out? This one holds two. I have another one on my hip, not to mention the big one over my shoulders. How many swings do you think you'll get in before you go deaf from the thunder or blind from flash? I like my odds, especially since they lack subtlety." You learn the *Deadshot* Gambit, and can use your Gambits an additional time between rests.

##### Outlaw
When you take this Caliber, you embody the thrill of the draw and the speed of combat. You learn the *Combat Roll* Gambit, and when you roll a die to reload a firearm and roll the maximum amount possible you may make an attack with that weapon as part of the same action.

##### Scoundrel
Scoundrels see the potency of firearms as an excellent way to complement their skills with other weapons. You learn the *Pressure* Gambit, and every time you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may pay one action in reload cost of a firearm that you are holding.

### Level 7
---
> Level 7 generally is flavourful, but for now I want to test these features
> Get the feel of the class
> An IDENTITY feature
> Choose one of the following passives ()
#### Caliber Feature
##### Artillerist
When you hit an attack with a firearm, roll a percentile dice. If the number rolled is equal to or lower than your level the attack critically hits. 

##### Outlaw
Each time you kill an enemy creature you earn a point. When you reload a firearm, you use all the points you've accumulated. For each point, the same number of initial bullets fired from that firearm will deal an additional die of damage.

##### Scoundrel
When a creature would provoke an opportunity attack from you, you may instead choose to draw a firearm and shoot that creature instead if you have a hand free.

When you hit a target with a firearm on your turn, you have advantage with melee attacks against that target until the end of your next turn.

#### Additional Gambit
You may choose an additional Gambit when you reach 7th level.
### Level 10
---
#### How Do You DO That?
The reloading speed of firearms are significantly reduced for you.
- When you roll a die to reload a firearm, you may add one to the roll.
- The action cost of firearms can instead be paid with an attack instead of an action.
- You ignore the "loading" property of firearms.

> Assume you have a farrondale weapon for your Calibre
> - Marksman Rifle for the Artillerist
> - Breach Revolver for the Outlaw
> - Bolt Pistol for the Scoundrel

### Level 15

### Level 18
---
### Calibre Feature
#### Outlaw


# Gambits
---
> Gambits should be actives
### Bug Out
When a firearm you are wielding runs out of ammunition your movement speed increases by 10ft. until the end of your turn.

### Combat Roll
On the same turn that you make an attack with a firearm or use any action to reload a firearm you may move up 15ft. in a straight line as a bonus action. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and any held action that you would trigger with this movement is instead triggered immediately at the end of your turn.

### Deadshot
As part of an attack made with a firearm you can damage a specific body part of your target. If the attack hits roll an additional damage die and remember this die's result. The target must make a Strength saving throw against an effect depending on what part of the body you target. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on the additional damage die (save ends at end of turn).

- **Legs or Wings** - the target's movement with the associated body part is halved.
- **Arms or Maw** - the target's attacks made with the associated body part deal half damage.
- **Eyes or Sensors** - the target's attack roles are made with disadvantage.

### Fake Out
As a reaction to a creature within normal range of your held firearm being attacked by another creature that they can see, you may use your firearm to give the attacker advantage on their attack roll. You may make a ranged weapon attack with your held firearm against the creature being attacked. If you dealt damage with an attack from a firearm to that creature since the beginning of your last turn, your ally has advantage on their attack roll.

You can use this Gambit after the initial attack role has been made, but before the DM declares whether the attack hits or misses.

### Low Profile
Half cover counts as three-quarters cover for you. In addition, you can attempt to hide when only partially obscured?

### Lights Out
Upon hitting a creature with an attack from a firearm you may draw a one-handed firearm and attack the same creature with that firearm as a bonus action.

### Pressure
When you gain this Gambit you no longer have disadvantage on attacks made with firearms against creatures within 5ft. of you. In addition, when you miss a creature with a melee attack, you may draw, attack the creature with, and stow a one-handed firearm (no action required). You don't add your ability modifier to this attack's damage. If you are holding one weapon in each hand, or are wielding a weapon and a shield, you drop one of these weapons as part of this Gambit.

### Ricochet
When you make an attack with a firearm and miss, the bullet miraculously ricochets of a nearby surface or armour. You can reroll the attack against a different creature within 30 feet of the original target.

If it is absolutely unfeasible for the environment to accommodate a ricocheting bullet, such as when the battle takes place while floating in the Astral Plane and there is no debris flying around, this Gambit does not function.

### Right Where I Want You
When a creature targets you with an attack you may, as a reaction, choose to automatically be hit by the attack. In return, you also may draw and automatically hit the attacker with an attack from a firearm. Both you and the attacker still may roll to see if you score a critical hit.

### Two Gun Fighting
When you take the Attack action and attack with a one-handed firearm that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different one-handed firearm that you're holding in the other hand. You can also load or reload a firearm without difficulty if your hands are full.

### Singeing Powder
You learn to create a unique blend of black powder known as *Singeing Powder*. When you fire a round loaded with *Singeing Powder*, a blast of combustion flies forth from your weapon's barrel in addition to the round fired.

Each creature in a 15ft. cone from your weapon in the direction of your original target must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target suffers fire damage equal to a roll of the weapon's damage dice on a failure, or half as much on a success.

### Concussive Powder
Thunder + stun or something

### Corrosive Powder

### Blinding Powder
