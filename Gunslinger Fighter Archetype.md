- **Outlaw** for [[Jarren Ward]]
- **Marksman** for [[Tybalt Farrondale]]
- Some kind of **Scoundrel** for pirates or someone who wants to augment

Features are at level 3, 7, 10, 15, and 18 and need to enable the use of firearms more. At level 3 will be a choice that defines "vibe" so choosing a calibre

>[!Note]
>Assume that the "gunner" feat and champion/battle master is a thing, so this needs to be balanced around being better than that
#### Outlaw
Mobile, roll to reload, most likely to wield a pepperbox or revolver early on
**Inspirational Outlaws**
- Cayde-6
- Cole Cassidy
#### Marksman
Guns and hitting things. Mandolorian?

Target specific body part
>[!Problem]
>##### How to make marksman shoot more than once per round?
#### Scoundrel
Blade and firearm + pirates + nuts beserk
- On melee hit reload point

Level 3, 7, 10, 15, 18
>[!Idea]
>When out of ammo gain +10ft.
# Gunslinger Traits

### Level 3
---
#### Firearm Proficiency
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms.
#### Gambit of Preference
Gambits represent the stylish tricks that Gunslingers are capable of performing with their weapons. When you gain the Gunslinger archetype, you learn one Gambit of your choice. You can swap out this Gambit when you level up. You can only use a gambit's active effect once per turn.

Once you use this feature up to a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you must finish a short or long rest to use a Gambit again. 

The DC associated with your Gunslinger Gambits is calculated as follows: $$\text{Gambit DC} =8 + \text{your proficiency bonus} + \text{your Intelligence or Dexterity mod (your choice)}$$
#### Gunslinger Calibre
Careful marksmen, bombastic outlaws, and crafty scoundrels are all unique embodiments of what a gunslinger means - whether that be aggressive mobility, reliance on accuracy, or supplementing already lethal weaponry with the force of black powder. Choose one of the following Calibres, which best suites your character's playstyle. You can swap out your Calibre when you level up.
##### Marksman
A trained elven archer can pin a fly to a tree from 500ft. away. A capable marksman can plug a hole in a man hiding behind the tree with the first guy's fly still stuck to the side. You learn the *Idk* Gambit, and can use your Gambits an additional time between rests
##### Outlaw
When you take this Calibre, you embody the thrill of the draw and the speed of combat. You learn the *Deadshot* Gambit, and when you roll a die to reload a firearm and roll the maximum amount possible you may make an attack with that weapon as part of the same action.
##### Scoundrel
Scoundrels see the potency of firearms as an excellent way to complement their skills with other weapons. You learn the *Pressure* Gambit, and every time you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may pay one action in reload cost of a firearm that you have equipped.
### Level 7
---
#### Calibre Feature
##### Marksman

##### Outlaw
Each time you kill an enemy creature you earn a point. When you reload a firearm, you use all the points you've accumulated. For each point, the same number of initial bullets fired from that firearm will deal an additional die of damage.
##### Scoundrel
When a creature would provoke an opportunity attack from you, you may instead choose to draw a firearm and shoot that creature instead if you have a hand free.
#### Additional Gambit
You may choose an additional Gambit when you reach 7th level.
### Level 10
---
#### Quick Loader
The reloading speed of firearms are reduced for you.
- When you roll a die to reload a firearm, you may add one to the roll.
- All other reload costs of firearms are reduced by 1 to a minimum of 1.
- You ignore the "loading" property of firearms.


>[!Important]
>At level 11, action surge attacks with pepperbox goes from 100% to 66% value
### Level 15
---

### Level 18
---
#### Calibre Feature


# Gambits
---
### Fake Out
As a reaction to a creature within normal range of your held firearm being attacked by another creature that they can see, you may use your firearm to give the attacker advantage on their attack roll. You may make a ranged weapon attack with your held firearm against the creature being attacked. If you dealt damage with an attack from a firearm to that creature since the beginning of your last turn, your ally has advantage on their attack roll.

You can use this Gambit after the initial attack role has been made, but before the DM declares whether the attack hits or misses.
### Pressure
When you gain this Gambit you no longer have disadvantage on attacks made with firearms against creatures within 5ft. of you. In addition, when you miss a creature with a melee attack, you may draw, attack the creature with, and stow a one-handed firearm (no action required). You don't add your ability modifier to this attack's damage. If you are holding one weapon in each hand, or are wielding a weapon and a shield, you drop one of these weapons as part of this Gambit.
### Deadshot
Something cowboy related
### Ricochet
When you make an attack with a firearm and miss, the bullet miraculously ricochets of a nearby surface or armour. You can reroll the attack against a different creature within 30 feet of the original target.

If it is absolutely unfeasible for the environment to accommodate a ricocheting bullet, such as when the battle takes place while floating in the Astral Plane and there is no debris flying around, this Gambit does not function.
### Lights Out
Upon hitting a creature with an attack from a firearm you may draw a one-handed firearm and attack the same creature with that firearm as a bonus action.
### Singing Powder
Does fire damage
### Concussive Powder
Thunder + stun or something
### Corrosive Powder
### Blinding Powder
