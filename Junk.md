# Mace of the Righteous

# Skye's Locket of the Armory
*Wondrous Item (Charm), Rare, Requires Attunement*
This thick coin-like charm is set with 6 amber crystals on the outward face. Each amber crystal acts as a small pocket-dimension which is used to store magical items. As an action, one can store an item that can be held in two hands in one of the crystals, and with the same action retrieve an item from one of the pockets. The locket knows what item you are asking for.

Additionally, while attuned, you gain an additional attunement slot. Once per day, as an action, or part of the retrieval and stowing of an item in one of the crystals, one can change this attunement slot to the item being retrieved. This ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
