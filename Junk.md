# Spear of Damnation
*Weapon (Spear), Legendary, Requires Attunement*
The Spear of Damnation is a weapon crafted of obsidian and black steel. Runes glow along the head of the weapon, and the handle is wrapped in a black leather. Its blade faintly smolders a bloody orange and black.

The Spear of Damnation has a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. While holding the spear, your Charisma score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score, and your spell attack rolls and spell save DC increase by 1. When you hit a creature with the Spear of Damnation, you deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage to that creature.

While holding the spear, you can cast *Searing Lash* from it. Use Charisma as your spellcasting ability score if you cannot already cast spells.

> The blacksmiths of Avernus are never wanting for components to fuel their creativity - often the most potent weapons are forged of the very essence of the enemies they are designed to fell.

>[!Searing Lash]
>Melee Spell Attack. 30 ft. 4d6 fire damage as an action, and the target cannot regain hitpoints until the start of your next turn

# Infernal Cuirass
*Heavy Armour (Plate), Very Rare, Requires Attunement*
You gain +2 to AC, +1 to Constitution saving throws, and can speak, read, and write Infernal. In addition you can use the armour to cast *hellish rebuke* at third level once per day.

> Cold to the touch red steel plates surround the wearer, while black chainmail protects the joints of the armour. The visages of tortured souls can be made out in the filigree of the metal, and hellish runes gently exude unholy light on the inside of the plates.
