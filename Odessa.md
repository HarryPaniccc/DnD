# Description
Lean, of medium height, and beautiful, Odessa has black hair cut short at her jaw, pale skin, and red eyes, with wings of deep black feathers. She is muscular and agile, wears black plate with red trim and a longsword at her hip.

Odessa is loyal to the archdevil [[Zariel]], but is an agent of order and punishment, bringing infernal retribution to mortals and fiends alike. Often she is sent to face and claim the souls of sinners, and to collect infernal payments.
