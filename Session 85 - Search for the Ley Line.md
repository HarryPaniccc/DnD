## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Returning from her adventure in [[Sirkonos]] to the familiarity of [[Dularen]] Rylai has begun to introspect about what her power means for who she is as a person 
- Dedicated to researching methods that will allow her to depart with the part of her magic that represents who she once thought she was meant to be, [[Rylai Sweetsong]] now believes that she has discovered the means of understanding her sorcerous magic: A [[Ley Lines|Ley Line]].
- Seeking a Ley Line she blah blah #TODO

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).


# Session Start

- Some way of determining what kind of elemental crossing she is looking for. Maybe the Ley Line will be used rather to **educate** her goal.
- She needs to go to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] through some kind of portal or by finding a [[Tuning Fork]].
- **Maybe Rylai gives the magic to Lina**
