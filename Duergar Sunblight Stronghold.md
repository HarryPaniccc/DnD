Around halfway through the [[Faults of North Estravia]] there is a mountain in which an ancient stronghold is situated. Long abandoned, the stronghold is now occupied by a clan of Duergar known as the [[Sunblight Clan]]. They seek to mine [[Black Ice]] that has been found occurring in the caverns that the ruined stronghold leads to. In addition, the [[Adult White Dragon]] [[Frostcleaver]] has laired in the caverns of the mountain. The Sunblighters have struck an accord with the dragon: They will provide it slaves to eat and will help refine the black ice they find to grow its horde, and in return it allows them to continue mining operations and defend the region surrounding the mountain.

A tribe of bugbears often makes their way through the [[Underdark]] to the stronghold in order to trade slaves with the duergar, but are not allied with them. Some of the bugbears act as muscle for the duergar.

### Room Ideas

- Dragon lair boss room
- Outside courtyard defence area and two turrets some few hundred feet from the courtyard
- Band of [[Battlehammer Clan]] dwarves maybe using a secret entrance to try delve into the caverns below
- Random Dragon encounter
