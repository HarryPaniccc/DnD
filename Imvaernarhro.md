**Imvarnarhro**, the Inferno of Anaroth, the guardian of the [[Heart of the Abyss]], is an ancient red [[Dragons of Helodaria|Dragon]] abiding in [[Anaroth the Sun Mountains]] near [[Desseran]]. Imvarnarhro, also named ***Inferno*** or ***Invarno*** is the descendant of the greatwyrm slain by the [[Unnamed Avatar of the Bahamut]], and the father of [[Chiaross]] of [[Sirkonos]].

His lair is above the hidden location of the [[Tomb of the God Emperor]], and the supposed final resting place of the [[Heart of the Abyss]]. He wishes to overlook the tomb of the so-called "father slayer".

Imvarno took the [[Tomb of the God Emperor]] some five hundred years before the time of the [[Vanguard]], around 300 PF. The [[Silver Talon]] decided it best to be left under his guard as there could conceivably be no better protection for the location.
