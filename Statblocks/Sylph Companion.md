> # Traits
> **As the Wind**. The Sylph can become as invisible as the wind at no cost, appearing only to those it wishes to be visible to. When it takes an action, its location is revealed until the start of its next turn due to bizarre shifting of the wind of a room, regardless if she is invisible or not. Outside of combat, its location might not be revealed.
> 
> **Flyby.** Opportunity attacks made against the Sylph are made with disadvantage.

### Actions
**Signature Attack (Air Burst).** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack*: +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5ft. or range 60 ft., one target, *Hit* (1d6) bludgeoning damage. This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when the Sylph reaches 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

**3rd Level: Buffeted by Gusts (3/day)**. When the Sylph hits a creature with a signature attack it can force the target to make a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 ft. in a straight line in any direction.

 **5th Level: Whirlwind (3/day).** As an action the Sylph emits a whirlwind of concentrated elemental energy. Each creature within 10 ft. of the Sylph must make a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving through or suffer PBd8 thunder damage and be pushed 10 feet directly away from the Sylph. 

 **7th Level: Chosen of the Currents (1/day).** As an action the Sylph summons intangible, lesser air elemental spirits. Up to PB chosen creatures within 30 ft. of the Sylph gain a lesser air elemental companion. For 10 minutes, each of those creatures gain a flying speed equal to their walking speed and can hover.
