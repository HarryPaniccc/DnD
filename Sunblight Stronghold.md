Around halfway through the [[Faults of North Estravia]] there is a mountain in which an ancient stronghold is situated. Long abandoned, the stronghold is now occupied by a clan of Duergar known as the [[Sunblight Clan]]. They seek to mine [[Black Ice]] that has been found occurring in the caverns that the ruined stronghold leads to. In addition, the [[Adult White Dragon]] [[Frostcleaver]] has laired in the caverns of the mountain. The Sunblighters have struck an accord with the dragon: They will provide it slaves to eat and will help refine the black ice they find to grow its horde, and in return it allows them to continue mining operations and defend the region surrounding the mountain.

A tribe of bugbears often makes their way through the [[Underdark]] to the stronghold in order to trade slaves with the duergar, but are not allied with them. Some of the bugbears act as muscle for the duergar.

# Planning
## Combats
- Dragon (outside)
- Dragon (lair)
- Duergar forces
- Rime Wraiths
- Frost Elemental
- Some mindless dungeon thing + Defences

## Zones
For the purposes of aligning with Chubby's dungeon ideas to separate the region into zones, the dungeon is broken into the following:
- **Front Entryway** is accessible from the [[Nalaziegel]]. This place is heavily guarded by Duergar, especially after a previous attack.
- **Black Ice Caverns** are populated by Duergar miners and the refining operation
- **Underdark** acts as an entrance for a bugbear tribe that sells slaves to the Sunblighters.
- **Crypts** have roaming undead from the dungeon's constructors. This region is largely unexplored by the other denizens of the dungeon as they have no interest in plundering it.

## Entrances
- Front = main entry, foolhardy
- Underdark = alternative
- Secret entrance which connects to the crypts and the black ice caverns
