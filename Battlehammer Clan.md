**Clan Battlehammer** is a very widespread clan of [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] with a strong sense of heritage. One of the oldest clans in [[Helodaria]], the Battlehammers have cousins and relatives in nearly every corner of modern civilisation, whether that be the fortress of [[Steinwalde]] to the north of [[Sirkonos]], or in hidden mountain fortresses in [[Zitrumea]].

Every clan head of clan Battlehammer would reasonably swear that their home, if it is ancient enough, is the ancestral home to the clan. The true home is the [[Mirthil Hall]] in the north of [[Zitrumea]].
