# Outline
---
The consequences of unclosed storylines coalesce as [[Eranulaid]] goes up in flames. War is brewing in every corner. The dark corners of the world are responding to the coming of a messiah that has long been foretold.

### Desired Plot Points Brainstorming

- The Red Wizard woman who has the vampire spawn has some kind of goal
- The [[Nightshade Peaks]] and a fortress there go to war with [[Desseran]] and [[Sirkonos]], [[Sion of Orcus]] in rulership
- [[General Isaac]] goes mad after assassinations take his wife and child
- [[Alfred Gundrei]] is elected king of [[Ruina]]

>[!Important]
>- Escalation needs to occur throughout each section.
>- This is the [[Vanguard|Vanguard's]] story, no one character's
## Prologue
Want to do an adventure where people find a clue to Sirkon and then die, starting the attacks on Desseran.

## Act 1 - [[City of the Glass Moon]]
The [[Duergar]] under the control of [[Zakuul]] are waging war with the [[Drow]] who imprisoned Zakuul, attacking the [[City of the Glass Moon]] and driving refugees and raiders to the surface. 

## Act 2 - War in [[Desseran]]

## Act 3 - [[Heart of the Abyss]]
