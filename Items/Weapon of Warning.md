# Mace of the Righteous
*Weapon (Mace), Uncommon, Requires Attunement*
This magic mace warns you of danger. While the mace is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The **mace** magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.
