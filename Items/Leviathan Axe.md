 **The Leviathan Axe

Runic weapon (battle axe), requires attunement, Legendary

# Stats:  
The Leviathan axe is a magical battle axe with the thrown property, with a range of 30/90. As a bonus action, while attuned, the wielder can cause the axe to fly back into their hand. The axe will not return if under an effect such as an area of no magic, or if the wielder is on another plane of existence.

The runes on this axe can be upgraded using rare materials, listed with each tier. Unlocking a tier will cause the runes on the axe to spray sparks of cold, and unlock certain perks.

## Tier 1
Cost: a tooth of a white dragon (harvested within a week of the dragon’s death), a shard of runite, 1000Gp
- The axe gains a +1 to attack and damage roles.
- When you hit an enemy with a ranged attack with this weapon they must make a constitution saving throw, the DC is 13. On a failed save, they are encased in ice and are paralyzed, and they have resistance to slashing, bludgeoning and piercing damage from non magical weapons. They can repeat the save at the end of their turns, and the effect is ended on a success. The effect ends if the axe is called back to its owner.
## Tier 2
Cost: Mithral (best get from the Wyrm Hole), Runite ingot, 2500 Gp, a frost giant’s soul (after applying the other 2 items, one must kill a frost giant using the axe in order to acquire this upgrade)
- The axe is improved to +2. The save DC is increased to 15.
- As a bonus action, you can choose to imbue the axe with permafrost. Bright blue ice grows around the axe head. While the axe is encased in this frost, it deals an extra 1d8 cold damage on all attacks, and sheds bright light for 5ft and dim light for another 5ft from the now-frozen axe head. The frost fades if your turn ends and you haven't hit a hostile creature with an attack since your last turn.
## Tier 3

Cost: 6000Gp, must be upgraded using the forge atop Vasspryg mountain or a similarly powerful forge, an ingot of runite, tempered using the frost breath of any dragon variant, requires the tooth of an adult or older White Dragon which was retrieved from the corpse of a beast slain within the last month. The tooth step can be applied at the end of the axe’s reawakening.

- The axe has reached its peak and is now a +3 weapon. Its thrown range is increased to 50/150, and the axe returns to your hand at will. When covered in frost, the axe now does 2d8 additional cold damage. The axe's save DC is now 17.
- As an action, you can slam the axe into the ground, creating an explosion of ice in a 20ft radius centred on you. Creatures you choose in the area must make a DC 17 constitution save or take 3d8 cold damage, those who succeed the save take half damage. Creatures who fail the save are covered in ice and are frozen petrified and can retake the save at the end of their turn, being unfrozen on success. Once released from the ice, or if the initial save was successful, their speed is reduced by half and are unable to take reactions until they use an action to rid themselves of the excess permafrost.
