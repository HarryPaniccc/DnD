### Magic Weapon
+3 to attack and damage rolls. On draw make the save or take damage 4d8 necrotic. 

When you draw *Nightfall*, until the next long rest you lose the ability to roll hit dice to heal in any way other than using *Nightfall*. When you hit a creature using *Nightfall*, you can expend a hit die and heal using it as if you had used it during a short rest.

### Butcher of Light
The first time you hit a creature with an attack using *Nightfall* on a turn that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a wound until the end of your next turn. Any slashing damage the creature takes while they are wounded increases by 2d6 *and your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on the creature on a d20 roll of 19 or higher.*

### Lifeblood
When you roll maximum damage on a damage die for an attack made with *Nightfall*, *Nightfall* gains a charge. You can gain only one charge per attack. These charges are all lost when *Nightfall* is sheathed or within 1 minute of not making a weapon attack against a creature or having damage dealt to you by an enemy. You can have no more than 8 charges at a time.

You may expend a number of charges in order to expel a great amount of power from *Nightfall*. You may use the following effects, reducing the number of charges held in *Nightfall* when you do.

- **Carve to the Bone (1 charge)**: *Nightfall* wounds even the most esoteric of foes. When you hit a creature with an attack made with *Nightfall* you may expend a charge to ignore its resistances to damage dealt by the attack, and treat immunities as resistances.
- **Blood Cleave (3 charges)**: _Nightfall_ extends into a vicious, blood-soaked blade, sweeping through foes in a 15-foot cone. Creatures within the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to #TODO. 
- **Rending Tide (3 or more charges)**: You cause tides of blood to whip around you. Any creatures within 10 ft. of you are forced to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 1d8 slashing damage or half as much on a success. Using this feature clears your stacks of Lifeblood. For every stack of Lifeblood over three that this feature clears, its damage increases by 1d8 and its range increases by 10 ft. If 6 or more stacks are cleared using this feature the dice is upscaled to a d10 and the attack ignores resistance to slashing damage and treats immunity to slashing damage as resistance instead.

The blade demands bloodshed. If you expend any charges using one of the above features and somehow deal no damage, you suffer 4d8 necrotic damage as [[Athelstan]] is infuriated at denying him bloodshed.

### Blood Fey's Curse
If *Nightfall* has more than 5 charges at the start of your turn Athelstan is powerful enough to attempt to take control of you. Make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC is 10 plus the number of charges *Nightfall* contains. On failure you become charmed by the wrathful entity imprisoned within.

While charmed in this way the number of charges *Nightfall* has is reset to 8 at the start of each of your turns. 

If the wielder of *Nightfall* dies with the blade in their hands, they must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or their body is immediately possessed by [[Athelstan]] and they become an NPC under the DMs control. If the wielder of Nightfallâ€™s alignment is not lawful they have disadvantage on this save. The character can not be brought back to life while [[Athelstan]] possesses them unless through use of a *Wish* spell.

*Nightfall* retains its properties in the hands of [[Athelstan]] but if used by anyone else is a +3 Longsword. If the possessed character is slain with *Nightfall* then [[Athelstan]] is re-imprisoned in the blade.
