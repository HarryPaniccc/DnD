# Planning
- +3 to attack and damage rolls. When you draw you must make a Wisdom save or take 4d8 necrotic damage.
- **Butcher of Light**: When you a creature them you inflict a wound until the end of your next turn (DC 17 Con save). Any slashing damage the creature takes while they are wounded increases by 2d6. *and melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on the creature on a D20 roll of 19 or higher.* When a creature that had a wound dies *Nightfall* gains a charge. These charges are all lost when *Nightfall* is sheathed, and you can have no more than 8 at a time.
- Gain a stack => ignore resistances to slashing
- **Blood Tither**: Blood follows you around.
- Cleave necrotic damage

> When you draw *Nightfall* until the next long rest you lose the ability to roll hit dice to heal in any way other than using *Nightfall*. When you hit a creature using nightfall, you can expend a hit die and heal using it as if you had used it during a short rest.

- **Ability 2** 
- Sheathing the blade: Charisma save of DC 20 minus number of stacks or swap places with Athelstan's mind for 1d12 hours
- Sentience stats: mental stats
