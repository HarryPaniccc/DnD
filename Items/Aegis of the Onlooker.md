# Aegis of the Onlooker
*Armor (Shield), Requires Attunement, Rare*
The Aegis is a great shield constructed of hammered steel and dark green iron. Adorned on the front of it are three gem-like eyeballs that cause unease and queasiness when stared at for too long. While wearing this shield, you have a +2 to Armor Class, in addition to the normal bonus to AC granted by it. In addition, three times a day, immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 psychic damage to that creature.
