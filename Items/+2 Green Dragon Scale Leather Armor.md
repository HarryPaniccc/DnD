Resist poison damage I guess. Requires attunement. Maybe just make it "Green Dragon Leather" and give it this

>*While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to poison damage.*
>
>*Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest green dragon within 30 miles of you. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.*
