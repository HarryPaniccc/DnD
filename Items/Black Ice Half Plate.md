# Black Ice Half Plate Armor
*Medium Armor (Half Plate), Rare, Requires Attunement*
While wearing this armour, plated with the nearly black crystaline mineral which appears similar to ice, you feel alone and unloved. You gain +1 to your AC while wearing this armour.

In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack while within 10ft. of you, that creature is blasted with pulse of frigid energy. The creature's speed is reduced by 10ft. until the end of their next turn. A creature's speed cannot be reduced by more than 30ft. this way. If a creature's speed is reduced to 0ft. in this way, the creature is *frightened* until the speed lost in this way is restored.

> "Black Ice has a history of corruption. The material is incredibly durable and magically potent. It often arises near rifts to the elemental plane of evil ice. Take care when mining the material, if your arm is strong enough to even mine it, and take greater care when refining it." - Note in *Rare Materials of the Northern Subterranean Realms*, Ch 23 by Baerick Hammerstone
