# Scrying Eye
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
A smooth, fist-sized glass ball, amethyst in hue, with a deep blue slit down the middle that causes it to appear like a cat's eye. The iris-like texture in the middle of the orb has a kind of gravity to it, as the slit always rights itself, and sometimes seems to be looking at whoever holds it. Once per day, recharging at dawn, a creature can use the eye to cast *Scrying*. The save DC of the spell is 15.
