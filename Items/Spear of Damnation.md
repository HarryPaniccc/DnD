# Spear of Damnation

*Weapon (Spear), Legendary, Requires Attunement*
The Spear of Damnation is a weapon crafted of obsidian and black steel. Runes glow along the head of the weapon, and the handle is wrapped in a black leather. Its blade faintly smolders a bloody orange and black.

The Spear of Damnation has a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. While holding the spear, your Charisma score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score, and your spell attack rolls and spell save DC increase by 1. When you hit a creature with Damnation, you deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage to that creature.

While holding the spear, you can cast *Searing Lash* from it. Use Charisma as your spellcasting stat if you cannot already cast spells.
