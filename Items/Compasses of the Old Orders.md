# Template Compass of the Old Orders
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*
A small metallic disk, a bit larger than the palm of your hand. On the curcimference are embossed five gems - the kinds that this one isnt - and two empty slots where gems once rested. At the center of the disk sits a gem. Pressing down of the gem activates the compass

One can use a compass to know in what direction any of the other active compasses are by pressing down on the gem that corresponds to the desired compass. A compass must be active to be found by another compass, but it does not need to be active to find another compass. If a target compass is not on the same plane as you, you know what plane the target is on based on a sigil that appears on the metallic face of this compass.
