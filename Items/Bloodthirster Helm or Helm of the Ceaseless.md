# Bloodthirster Helm
*Wonderous Item (Helmet), Very Rare, Requires Attunement*
The mask of this metal helmet melds to form a terrible visage of the wearer's choice. While looking into the cavity of this helmet, you hear wind as if listening down a vast hallway.

While attuned to this helmet you are proficient with heavy and medium armour, and any features that you possess from any source that do not function if you are wearing armour of some kind function normally regardless of what armour you are wearing. Shields are unaffected. In addition, you may use your strength modifier instead of your dexterity modifier when determining armour class.
