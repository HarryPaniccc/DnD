# Potion of Hill Giant Strength
*Potion, Uncommon*
When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 21 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

> A sliver of a hill giant's fingernail is suspended in this potion, and the foul stench renders it unpleasant to swallow.
