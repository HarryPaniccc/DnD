# Marthirion's Staff | Staff of the Void
*Staff, Rare, Requires Attunement by a Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock or Wizard*
This staff of ironwood and obsidian is often cracked and gnarled with points of purple, wriggling movement seemingly moving through the wood. You have resistance to psychic damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *life drain* (5 charges), *living shadows* (4 charges), *maddening whispers* (2 charges), or *void strike* (3 charges). You may cast the *word of misfortune* cantrip without expending a charge.

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to ash and is destroyed.

> Your eyes wander beyond your reckoning. Only a fool stares at the sun hoping to see what is behind it.

>[!tip] Life Drain
> *6th-level necromancy*
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
> **Range:** 90 feet
> **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous
> ---
> With a snarled word of Dark Speech, you create a swirling vortex of purple energy. Choose a point you can see within range. Creatures within 15 feet of the point take 10d6 necrotic damage, or half as much with a successful Constitution saving throw. For each creature damaged by the spell, you can choose one other creature within range, including yourself, that is not a construct or undead. The secondary targets regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage you rolled.

>[!tip] Living Shadows
> *5th-level illusion*
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
> **Range:** 120 feet
> **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 minute
> ---
> You whisper sibilant words of Dark Speech that cause shadows to writhe with unholy life. Choose a point you can see within range. Writhing shadows spread out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, grasping at creatures in the area. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the shadows. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the shadows must make a successful Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
>
> A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

>[!tip] Maddening Whispers
> *2nd-level necromancy*
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
> **Range:** 30 feet
> **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 minute
> ---
> You whisper a string of Dark Speech toward a target that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be incapacitated. While incapacitated by this spell, the target's speed is 0 and it can't benefit from increases to its speed. To maintain the effect, you must use your action on subsequent turns to continue whispering; otherwise, the spell ends. The spell also ends if the target takes damage

>[!tip] Void Strike
> *3rd-level evocation*
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
> **Range:** 90 feet
> **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
> ---
> With a short phrase of Dark Speech, you gather writhing darkness around your hand. When you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns, you can unleash a bolt of darkness at a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack. If your target is in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on the roll. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 necrotic damage and is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

>[!tip] Word of Misfortune
> *Enchantment cantrip*
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
> **Range:** 60 feet
> **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
> ---
> You hiss a word of Dark Speech. Choose one creature you can see within range. The next time the creature makes a saving throw during the spell's duration, it must roll a d4 and subtract the result from the total of the saving throw. The spell then ends.
