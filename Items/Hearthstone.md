# Hearthstone
*Wondrous Item, Rare*
This irregular geometrically carved crystal has an ornate steel and brass base. The crystal itself is of a vibrant blue, with an opaque, beautifully latticed center. Those who hold it in their hand feel a comforting warmth, as though holding a warm mug of tea.

When a hearthstone is left in a room for 24 hours, the hearthstone becomes attuned to that room. A hearthstone can be attuned to only one room at a time. Once per day, recharging at dawn, a creature can use the hearthstone to cast the *Word of Recall* spell as an action.
