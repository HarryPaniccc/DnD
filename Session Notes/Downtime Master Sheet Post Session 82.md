### Gold at the start of downtime
I'm not going to track each gold piece but its a good idea to get an idea of funds right now.

| **Character** | **Gold**          |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Kanan         |                   |
| Caede         | 18Pp 1500Gp 113Sp |
| Rylai         |                   |
| Silb          |                   |
| Isilme        | 203Gp             |
| Dusk          | 101Pp 26Sp        |
