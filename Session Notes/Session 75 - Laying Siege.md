**GENERAL NOTES**
- Banahras 5th
- Midst of the [[Battle of Strahldale]], the Roc has just been defeated
- Raiding the Vorciln defenses
## Town Center
The center of town is the main location of tithing. There are bodies stripped of their clothes and slit at their feet to have the blood be drained out of them into bowls. A raised pedestal with runes carved into it is being used for bloodletting into the vessel.
- [[Syr Emelia Richstrahd]] will arrive on horseback, pursued by two soldiers, will engage and kill both of them.
#### Barn
The barn in town is filled with many of the non-escaped townspeople, wearing either torn up rags or stripped of their possessions. There are about 50 of them.
- There is an established escape route. Arthur will volunteer to ensure that they all make it out alive

## Returning to Kenifria
The castle's rear balconies overlook a massive hole tunneled down into a different wing of Kenifria. The crystals in the cavity pulse with vibrant blue and purple energies. The way down is simply a sheer cliff but at the bottom there are softly glowing lights, as well as
