**WHEN LAST WE LEFT OFF**
The Vanguard in their plight to avenge the family clan of Kanan Einzbern, formerly known as Jarren Ward, have adventured across the western kingdom of Sirkonos in search of a means of defeating the vampire clan Vorciln - lead by vampire lord Lucius. Learning of Lucius' true motives, to free an ascended vampiric entity from his millennia of imprisonment under the sun of the feywild. With the word of the crowned prince at your back, you rallied a force of rangers and raiders and knights, and laid siege to the Vorciln castle that had taken control of the village Strahldale. After a long battle, you descended into the birthplace of the Einzberns, Kenifria, and, separated, Kanan and Isilme faced Kanan's lost older brother, Tevis, in a terrible duel, and managed to defeat him. In bringing him to defeat, they managed to lift the mire on his mind, and through a healing potion, prevented his death. At the same time, Caede, Rylei and Skye faced Elandra, and through the rallying of the rest of the group, Tevis was able to channel the holy blessings of Lathander, and permanently put an end to his tormentor and torturer. After reuniting with the rest of the vanguard, you made your way towards the crypts of Kenifria, into an unexplored section nearing the site of the rift, towards the rite of unholy severance.
## The Rite of Unholy Severance
The rite of unholy severance is taking place in a great chamber above the Sanctum of the Kenifrian stronghold where Athelstan was first sealed away. The stairway leads upwards from a section of the crypts into the ritual chamber - once a great ceremony room. The walls of the room have crumbled away, and black magic energy flows upwards from the antechamber below.

#### NPC's strategy
**Lucius**
- Round 1: Action will be to cast Shadow of Moil on himself if he goes early
- Afterwards: Multiattack as he sees fit, trying to hit someone with a hurl through hell
- If he gets hit really hard, odds are by Kanan, he will power word pain them
**Narzugon**
- Infernal command then terrifying command
- When Lucius is low he will use healing touch
- The nightmare will constantly dash or disengage to allow fly by attacks
**Aerondite**
#### Factors to Consider
- Fractured Leviathan Axe
- Arthur
- The ghost

## Encounter: The Man with the Golden Gun
- Poison on the floating blade
