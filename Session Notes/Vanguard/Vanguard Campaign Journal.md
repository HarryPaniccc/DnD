I think this should be an arc summary document. Link to arc pages, but have summaries and links to session notes. I think session notes should each have a summary timeline appended to them **after** the session. Maybe summaries of who is doing what in an arc? Links to the [[Vanguard]].

# Arc 4: Chains of the Past
In the year 812 Post Fall the [[Vanguard]] faced off against the [[Halo of Chains]], led by [[Caede]]'s brother, [[Galund]], in a race to prevent him from finding the souls of the lost [[Valkuur]] and reclaim enough power to reshape the [[Religion|religions]] of the world so that the [[Deities of Helodaria|Gods]] no longer had any control over the [[Material Plane]].

# Arc 3: Tenets of Corruption
Following a trail of clues which led them to the [[Oakrot Woods]], the [[Vanguard]] pursued a warlock known by the name of [[Garen]] to [[Dularen]], entering the metropolis for the first time. What would follow was a web of conspiracy, leading to the freeing of [[Alfred Gundrei]] from the demonic influence of the Glabrezu demon [[Thezuurol]], and their receiving of [[Trayfort Keep]], and their titles as lords of the city.
