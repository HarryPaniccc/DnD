**Last session**
- Began preparations to seal [[Athelstan]] away in a new prison, one not reliant on the continued lineage of the [[Einzberns]] and more hidden.
- Deciding to seal him within the [[Vessel of Avarice]], you started the creation of a new mutagen using some of Dusk's changeling blood.
- Cautious of the dangers of using the Vessel, you went shopping for various components for spells and wards that would protect the person channeling its power from any potential possessions from Athelstan's side.
- Two of you returned to Dularen by way of a Teleportation spell and met with the squadron of [[Ashen Legion]] soldiers that were tasked with guarding [[Trayfort Keep]], mainly their captain [[Eduleth Hallowleaf|Eduleth]] who gave you a written summons to [[Castle Gundrei]] to meet with [[Alfred Gundrei|Lord Gundrei]]
- After shopping around in [[Dularen]] for magical scrolls and components in the [[Gilded Resolution]] you met with Lord Gundrei who scolded you for leaving the defence of your fort in the debt of Dularen.
- Before they returned the manor was visited by the Fist of Sirkonos, [[Syr Renslayer]], riding atop his great brass dragon. The Hand of the King mandated that he was to escort the prince back to [[Leerehalt]] where his father was waiting for him. After some quick goodbyes he departed, taking with him a [[Sending Stone]] so that he and Kanan might remain in contact before they were officially summoned.
- Afterwards you prepared the ritual with a series of protection spells over the course of a day and Rylei attuned to the Vessel of Avarice, immediately feeling the intensity of its effects.
- After Kanan took his new dose of the mutagen, the profane drug coursing through his body, the rune on his hand burning like a hundred forges he waited the night out in extreme agony for preparations to be completed.
- What followed in the ritual had Kanan reach through the portal and imprison Athelstan in the Chalice, his form burning up from the rage of the blood fey, but his divine blood harnessing that rage and remaking it, rekindling his power and the new mutagen, changing his body and returning his blood hunter powers to him.
### Isilme's Ritual
---
In order for Isilme to become dhampir and control the vampiric curse she will need to find someone who can protect her soul from being corrupted by the curse. [[Einzberns]] before have tried and failed. 
**Prices**
- Alchemy check using 1000 Gp of ingredients.
- The ritual requires the use of Vampire teeth and blood
- New brand to be constructed

>[!Transition]
>The liquid from within the cup drains through you. It is viscous. Bitter. After a moment a fire begins to burn through your veins. The muscles of your form bulge as veins of red etch through your form. You feel the changes reach through your body. The symbol on your back acting as a catalyst between your form and the substance that races through you. At the center of the rune on your back, the shape of a sword is formed and it begins to burn. You reach back, your hands forming claws that tear at the clothes on your back, leaving them tattered around you. Blood pours down your back as you almost unwillingly claw at the shape. The blood flows, but unlike before when you have been wounded in battle... it is cool. Cold. You arch your head back and unleash a violent scream as fangs become visible to those around. When you are finished, you collapse in a pulse of mist and light, as your hair shines a beautiful white silver.

**Isilme's Changes**
- Ask her to describe physical changes
- Her canines can grow into longer fangs that allow her to drain blood
- This terrible thirst accompanies her
- Fears running water
- Once per day she may cast *Misty Step*
### Summons To [[Leerehalt]] OR [[Diredahl]]
---
An escort will summon the Vanguard to the location **two days** after Isilme's ritual. 
### Meeting with [[King Sirkon]] "Sikarius"
---
King Sirkon is draped in regal, warm garments of deep greys and blacks, with an overcoat of blue with purple stitching, bearing the house colours. His hands are pale tired old things that bear the marks of a war fought long ago, and various rings that are of unknowable value. On a table next to him sits an ancient crown of mithril bearing jewels and a golden inlay. He sits playing a slow but measured tune on a violin with the expertise of master musician. To his side, in ornate armor bearing the head of a dragon on a pauldron and a silk cloak stands Renslayer, almost large enough to be confused with one of the pillars of the room.
#### Points of order
- **What is the value of a blade.** Complex in purpose, simple in use. It cuts. But does whether it cuts the throat of a king or the hand of a thief or the loin of a swine determine its value? Or is it the history of the lives it has ended determine its value? This blade was forged some time after the Thayan Empire overthrew the old Desseran kingdom and established its control over all of Eranulaid. It has been passed between assassins hands for centuries, it is the cause of the deaths of a few of my ancestors, and it is older than the name of the kingdom you find yourself in. But it has sat over there, on a counter, for over four hundred years. Unused, dull, covered in what little dust the Kronesguard permit. So I ask, what value, truly, is in an unused blade?
- **Kanan raised to Syr Einzbern** and granted the title of Count. The Einzbern manor will be reconstructed. His company are to be raised to knighthood, viscounts of Sirkonos in their own rights.
- **Royal Seals of Authority** for each member of the Vanguard will permit them entrance to any city you desire, as well as act as a mark of the noble deeds they have accomplished.
- **Battalion of the Silver Arrow**. 83 member's dead names are emblazoned upon banners that will be added to Royal decorations. Kanan will have two of the companies of the Silver Arrow placed under him as he is prepared for his role.
- **Compasses of The Old Orders**: 6 compasses each with: Diamond, Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, Amethyst, Opal, and two open holes.
#### It didn't  have to be like this ember but here we are
- The room is lined with four counterspell glyphs at 9th level (triggered sequentially when someone other than designated members cast spells near them)
- Each counterspell has another glyph that feebleminds the caster upon previous glyph cast (HIS DC = 25)
- [[Chiaross]] is perched nearby and can climb through one of the windows with ease.
- Still need to stat Renslayer guess that will be homework
- 

"What is the value of this blade?"
