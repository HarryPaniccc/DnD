**JARREN WARD GHOST**

[[Jarren Ward]] has been following Eren for a long time. He is constantly in Erens head, and since seeing Kanan he has been trying to find out how to contact him from the Ethereal plane.

- A silver mist surrounds the cave as the vanguard sleep. In the calmness of slumber, Kanan is brought into a dream - appearing to be awake but in truth he is dreaming.
    

You arise in the crystal-filled chamber. You think you might have nodded off to sleep for just a moment. The whitenoise rush of water from the waterfall at the entrance is very calming. The cavern is filled with darkness, besides a few embers from the dying fire. You sit calmly in your post, until, for just a single exhale, you see your breath condense in a deep fog, despite it not being that cold. Through the fog, a thin, silver light can be viewed beyond the corner that leads to the entrance.

- None of Kanan’s companions are in their bedrolls. He is alone.
    

Approaching the waterfall, your reflection stares back at you. You can see the majority of your defining features. Your strong build, the brigandine you wear, your hair is well kept. The water shifts, distorting your image a bit.

When you focus again, the image staring back at you is not yourself. A ghostly, mist-covered hand reaches out and grabs you by the shoulder, pulling you in at a speed that you cannot react to. As you are thrust through the waterfall, you feel dirt beneath you. You open your eyes to see the sky above you, overcast and with rain pouring down upon you, through a broken hut on the side of a mountain.

“Hey kid, I was hoping you would wake up.”

You look over to see a wounded, shirtless, unshaven and dying, Jarren ward, leaning against the side of the hut. Your eye still burns beneath its eyepatch, and your body still aches from the last few weeks of travelling.

- Go get the bucket of water outside
    

Time is running out kid but you're doing so well. Keep. Going. Find the answers. Your’e almost done. Follow the whispers. Find the answers. What Lucius is. You're in the right place. Just keep going. Kanan. KANAN.

End.  

PASSAGE THROUGH THE CAVERNS

- The path onward is entirely dark
    

Heading deeper into the caverns, your path is at a constant descent. The air grows thick and stagnant, and the temperature plummets to the point of freezing. After spending around 20 minutes walking, the decline of the path grows more treacherous. You come to a small collection of pools with water in them, formed naturally from the mineral depositing and eroding process.

- There is a steep drop, roughly 40 to 50 degrees in angle, with gentle streams of water flowing down them. Large crustal formations line the surfaces of the chamber. A few of them are slightly luminous: Candlestone, a gentle orange light flows from the centre of one of these crystals and sheds dim light for 5ft.
    
- The drop is around 15 metres down (50 ft) with the incline providing much opportunity to slip. Climbing down the incline requires a DC 18 dexterity check to do so unassisted safely. 
    

- Upon failure, the character will slip and scrape along the rough, crystal covered ground. Those in armour are affected less by the sliding as they are better covered.
    

- Heavy: 1d4 to 5d4 slashing damage depending on degree of failure
    
- Medium: 1d6 to 5d6 slashing damage
    
- Light: 1d8 to 5d8 slashing damage
    

At the bottom of the drop there is a shallow pool of water that leads into a tunnel, whose entrance is blocked by a rocky outcrop about eye level, making getting through while standing impossible. The pathway has a small dip downwards around 5 metres in and then flattens out, opening into the next chamber.

THE STEINEFNI MINING OUTPOST

The cave’s pathway lowers into a puddle-filled chamber about 15 ft high, with mineral deposits acting as pillars. Across the way from the entrance, roughly 20 ft opposite the entrance, there stands a magnificent wall constructed of dark, treated wood and intricately carved metal. Parts of the foundation appear to be made of large stone blocks. At the center of it there is what appears to be a massive metal plate with dwarvish carvings and a keyhole in the middle.

- A DC 22 perception check to listen to the other side of the wall: “Straining your ears, cutting out the ambient dripping and flow of water in the surrounding area and trying your best to ignore the noise from your fellow party members, you can barely make out the sound of movement of footfalls and the echoes of steel on the other side of the wall.”
    
- The lock can be picked with a DC 20 lockpicking tools check.
    
- The wall is valued around 10 000 Gp, and any damage done to the wall will anger Drulin and he will request recompensation.
    

  
  

Characters of significance

- Drulin Grafteye. Bald at the top with a shaved jaw but a bushy patch of beard on his chin that connects with his moustache. Accent is short and ashy, somewhat deep and Sirkonian. The treasurer of the mines for all 98 years of its operation, as well as the health and safety regulations officer, Drulin oversees much of the mine’s activities and is well respected within the company.
    
- Eivor Stonehand. Accent is norse with a rasp from too much beer. Thick, blonde dwarf hairstyle and wears a breastplate made of hammered iron, with two swords on his side. The operational manager, he ensures everyone keeps their load well lifted in the mines.
    

THE PATH DEEPER

Both Drulin and Eivor have been on the mine for a long time, Drulin since the beginning, and Eivor for 50-odd years. They will have the information on how to plunge deeper into the caverns to arrive where the Vanguard are headed.

- At the deepest part of the currently operated section of the Steinefni mines there is a drawbridge that is strictly prohibited to cross - there have been known disappearances beyond, so it was deemed irresponsible to continue operation beyond that point.
    
- Past the drawbridge is an abandoned, once occupied section of the Steinefni mines. The area is much the same as the current mining outpost, only devoid of any useful tools: It was well disassembled, all useful items being taken when operations ceased.
    
- At the deepest section of the abandoned wing, there is an opening where a gently flowing river of water, well illuminated by glowing crystals, flows deeper into the cavern system. Beyond this point, the caves really expand outwards and are entirely unmapped.
    

Drulin has a keystone that will unlock the large wooden doors that block off the underground river in the abandoned mineshaft.

This information is known by both Eivor and Drulin. Drulin will communicate this more cautiously, and he will not mock or berate the party for their efforts, but he will direct them and caution them against dangers.

DESERTED MINE WING

At the end of the central mine shaft the stone on the ground grows noticeably less worn. The sound of rushing water grows until the entire cavern is engulfed in the roaring cacophony. The tunnel itself has a few exposed, beautiful crystals jutting out, and there is a cluster of unique looking, reflective, metallic rock formations at the bases of the support pillars that form this side of the bridge. The structure itself is a wood and metal span that would stretch across a roughly 40 ft chasm, stretching all the way up to the surface.

There are a series of ropes hanging across the ceiling, there are buckets hanging up high, offerings to Moradin.

- Off to the side there is a water wheel dug into the side of the chasm, 15ft away from the opening and just barely visible in the rock. There are visible striations and cracks and chips in the rock leading up to it that would make it climbable.
    

- The mechanism to activate the drawbridge and make it roll down is blocked due to a broken spoke in the water wheel, and the spoke needs to be removed to allow the mechanism to rotate properly.
    
- The torrent of water will impose disadvantage on anyone trying to climb to the mechanism to make repairs.
    
- Climbing to the water wheel requires a DC 18 athletics check.
    

--Encounter 2 x Wyverns on the bridge

Immediately after the repair is made and the drawbridge sides collapse, a pair of wyverns will swoop down and attack the party.

There is a reverberation in the ground and the sound of cranks turning and chains shifting and you watch as the massive halves of wooden drawbridge come down in a synchronized and surprisingly controlled descent. You think for a moment that the water pouring down with such intensity might prove too much for the structure, but the dwarven engineering, nothing even gives an inch once it has settled.

Once the bridge anchors, the wyverns will attack.

- The weight of the water makes controlled flight impossible, but otherwise, in the pace of battle, manoeuvring through the torrent of the waterfall counts as difficult terrain, and a turn cannot be ended while flying in the waterfall.
    
- Wyverns: HP: 136 each, no other changes.
    

ABANDONED MINESHAFT

Descending further down this section of the mine there is this obvious air of stillness in the space. Despite the ever present sound of rushing water, it's quiet in here. There is a section of wooden platform that has been constructed over a luminous crystal cluster providing an eerie light to the quiet mineshaft. The tunnel coils downwards and rightwards somewhat tightly. To the left of the descent there is an observation window in the wooden support that shows you the scale of this abandoned section.

- There is a claw crane that hangs overhead in a massive cavern.
    
- There are channels of water flowing overhead to water wheels that are not activated.
    
- There are no recoverable items of real value that can be found in the area, other than:
    

- 5 buckets hung overhead in the main area as offerings to Moradin. Inside each bucket is: 
    

- 46 silver
    
- 19 gold and 11 silver
    
- a silver cast hammer worth 50 gold
    
- The hilt of a sword with golden filigree worth 15 silver
    
- A runestone with the name “Beergur” on it
    

- In the ash of a cold forge there is a beautiful, thick silver signet ring sent into the forge as it was dying, so it melted and deformed just slightly.
    

The signet ring is cursed. The DC for all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls made by a creature wearing the ring is increased by 1. Trying to cast the ring away fails, the ring magically reappearing in their most easy to access pocket. A Remove Curse Spell will cause the warping of the forge to be undone, and the ring is returned to its uncursed form (Worth 15gp).

At the bottom of the decline of the central chamber, the sound of running water returns, but more calmly.

A pair of large wooden doors block further descent into caverns. A beautifully carved stone and wood bar looks to be almost fused with the door, barring its use. There are arcane dwarvish symbols on the outer inlay of the bar that faintly glow in a gentle green colour. The carving on the outer face of the bar  is that of twisting knots, with viking-like symbolism. 

Holding the keystone up to the bar there is a gentle shimmer of green light that connects the two, and the stone dissolves in your hand into light green embers. A moment passes. Another passes. Then from the seam of the door, a shimmer of green energy makes tangled carvings on the bar recoil and untangle as the bar dissolves from the centre outward.

- At the bottom of an almost entirely unchanged stretch of cavern, there is a gentle river, flowing calmly into the depths of the mountain. Beside the river, there hangs a duo of rowing boats, two oars apiece.
    
- The boats are able to fit 4 people comfortably, but have clearly been designed to fit 6 dwarves.
