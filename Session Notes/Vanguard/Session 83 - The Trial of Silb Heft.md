## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light.

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.

- Silb has received a summons from his good friend [[Brindor Shieldwall]] to meet him in [[Dularen]] at the [[Dularen Heart-Kiln]]
- He does not know much about why, but he knows it has something to do with the armor that he had commissioned the [[Mountreach Heart-Kiln]] to forge for him some months ago
- He called upon the aid of a [[Dragonborn]] Sorcerer by the name of [[Woed]] to return from [[Sirkonos]] to [[Dularen]].

### Opening Monologue

> The night air is cold threatening to cool you through your simple clothing. Your destination, you know, is to find [[Brindor Shieldwall|Brindor]] at the [[Dripping Barrel Inn]] in [[Dularen]]. You told him you wanted to be discreet, so its likely he will have secluded himself one way or another. You need merely find him.
> 
> The day is the **19th** of **Banahras**, 813, and you are flying through the [[Ethereal Plane]].

# Session Start

Message from [[Brindor Shieldwall]]:
> *Silb, you are being summoned by Lord Stormshield. This is about your armour. You aren't in trouble. Find me at the Dularen Heart Kiln soon.*

# Summons to [[Dularen]]

### The [[Dripping Barrel Inn]]
The Dripping Barrel is lively this time of year. The chill of winter's approach makes many seek out a warm hearth and a good mug of beer or ale. The tavern is alive with gentle music and the smell of roasting meats and spices.

[[Brindor Shieldwall]] has taken a sitting room for himself beyond the main tavern area and has told [[Albanny Halonoth]] to expect Silb and point him in the right direction

### What [[Brindor Shieldwall|Brindor]] Knows
Brindor will be kind and eager to see Silb again, but will be unsure about his decision to be hush hush about their meeting.

- Lord [[Thordan Stormshield]] became interested in the armour being forged some weeks ago
- [[Brindor Shieldwall|Brindor]] knows that many of the [[Mountreach]] leadership have taken an interest in your place in the [[Moradin]] church, especially after you commissioned one of the dwarves' most sacred armours
- Some may wish to see you cast from the worship due to your [[Goblin]] ancestry, while others, including [[Mjothi]]
- [[Thordan Stormshield|Lord Stormshield]] took the armour upon its completion, and has now summoned you to his home in [[Mountreach]]

Brindor suggests bringing along people who can vouch for Silb.
