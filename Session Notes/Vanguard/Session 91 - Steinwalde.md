## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Caede and Kanan, having traversed incredibly treacherous terrain surrounding the western reaches of the [[Maghlas Mountains]] have finally, after a monthlong journey, have made it to the beautiful sights of one of the grand gates to [[Steinwalde]], the great dwarven fortress city of [[Eranulaid]].
- After meeting with a group of dragon hunters known as the [[Flamebrands]] led by a warrior who went by the name [[Gaz the Branded]] they battled off an attack by a massive fire dragon who went by the name [[Oriothar the Monarch]]. The group managed to down a younger red dragon, claiming it and tying its carcass to the large sled that the flamebrands keep with them, and began a long and arduous hike back towards [[Steinwalde]]
- The sight that greeted them was one of warfare in the night air, as a massive army of orcish and giant forces lay seige to the walls of the Steinwalde entryhall defences. The pair rushed down to help as the line of defence broke near an [[Infernoguard Tower]], and dug themselves in, as they now do battle with a huge force of orcs, and a fire giant who has his sights set on destroying the tower which provides the wards against fire that the steinwaldie need to protet their home.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
