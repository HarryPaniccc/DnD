- The group completes introductions with Boryg and makes their way into the [[Steinwalde]] Entryhall, enjoying an incredible meal with the prince of the Steinwaldie.

**Dul'ussahn 17th**
- 11:00 Caede and Kanan make acquaintence with [[King Dharn the Blacklock]] and he tells them of the loss of the [[Zundulkhar]]

- They tell the group of their need to reforge [[Anathema]], fix the [[Leviathan Axe]], and to deal with the [[Vessel of Avarice]], as well as a number of other trades
- Kanan needs to do dragon armour forging, he wishes to do shopping, and everyone wants some generic trading.

## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

## Recap
> **Much has happened** these past weeks, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Caede and Kanan, having traversed incredibly treacherous terrain surrounding the western reaches of the [[Maghlas Mountains]] have finally, after a monthlong journey, have made it to the beautiful sights of one of the grand gates to [[Steinwalde]], the great dwarven fortress city of [[Eranulaid]].
- After meeting with a group of dragon hunters known as the [[Flamebrands]] led by a warrior who went by the name [[Gaz the Branded]] they battled off an attack by a massive fire dragon who went by the name [[Oriothar the Monarch]]. The group managed to down a younger red dragon, claiming it and tying its carcass to the large sled that the flamebrands keep with them, and began a long and arduous hike back towards [[Steinwalde]]
- The sight that greeted them was one of warfare in the night air, as a massive army of orcish and giant forces lay seige to the walls of the Steinwalde entryhall defences. The pair rushed down to help as the line of defence broke near an [[Infernoguard Tower]], and dug themselves in, as they now do battle with a huge force of orcs, and a fire giant who has his sights set on destroying the tower which provides the wards against fire that the steinwaldie need to protet their home.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).

## Characters and their goals and knowledge
##### [[Prince Boryg the Brash]]
- Boryg will welcome the fighters after having heard the battle report of how they defended an [[Infernoguard Tower]]. Should the pair fail to defend the tower, Boryg will not think highly of them.
- Boryg will be able to introduce everyone to [[Thran the Anvil]] and to [[Grelchar the Keen]]

##### [[Gaz the Branded]]
- Gaz will want to pull Caede aside at some point and speak to him about his abilities and how he might be helpful.
