**Previous Session:** [[Session 86 - The Synod of Elevation]]
**Subsequent Session:** 
## Introduction 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light.

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Rylai Sweetsong]], aided by the [[Vanguard]] and with direction from [[Darius Nubide]], has sought out an ancient ruin - the [[Synod of Elevation]] - where she believes she may find the next step in dispelling her sorcerous magic, and being free of the wounds from her past
- On their journey to the ruin a few hours west of [[Vasspryg]], the group encountered the renowned [[General Isaac]] of the [[Boreal Conclave]], and nearly made a new enemy, but ended up potentially made a new ally. They learnt more about why [[Ulrandir Vanariel]] had not yet been executed, and were told that, in order to get a full story, they must speak with their close ally: [[Alfred Gundrei]].
- Now, having hired a small company of bodyguards, the group set out into the ruin, where, after activating a magical trap and unleashing a type 4 demon in the form of a hidieous Nalfeshnee, the three were teleported to an unknown dungeon location.
- Now, having explored the region somewhat, Rylai was faced with a task of some kind where she had to choose between the three elements of water, air, and fire, representing stillness, freedom, and passion in a way. She chose the elemental shard of fire, and the the chamber began to shift, as a group of elementals, mixed between the elements of water and air, rose up and attacked the group.

## Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one thing's for certain, you were not expecting to be faced with so personal a trial.
> 
> The day is the 29th of *Antumbrahn*, 813, and you steel yourself to do battle once again. Roll initiative.

### Elemental Essence Chamber
Ornate shapes on the walls, depicting various different planes
Four pedistals, one broken, give of a faint light. On the floor, mosaic of the inner planes, depicting the elemental planes.

On the second floor, the viewing platform, about 15 ft. above the ground floor, the ornate decorations continue.
- There is an empty armour stand that looks as though it was meant to hold plate armour of some kind
- Four ornate candelabras made of electrum (100 Gp each) sit with candles long since burned away. They are, however, each clearly dusted by someone in the last day or so, as they are cleaner than the environments
- On the walls depict primal elemental forces given vague shapes, with eyes of precious inlayed in the structures.  2 ambers, pearls, sea-green jades and Chrysoberyls (transparent yellow-green) each worth 100 gp.

The top chamber level here leads to the minister's chambers, as well as the viewing room in the **Wandering Mind Chamber**.
##### **ENCOUNTER** - Water, Air elemental, 3 x  ice mephits
Upon choosing the [[Elemental Essence Shard (Fire)]], Rylai has summoned the contained wrath of the two elementals that remain in the chamber.
### Wandering Mind Chamber
Here sits destroyed series of four altars meant to seat people's bodies while under the effects of the _astral projection_ spell.
- There is, at the end of the room, sitting on an ornate weapon stand, a [[Silver Dagger]], curved and vicious looking, with a ruby set in the pommel. The weapon is a magical tool, meant to sever the *Silver Chord* connecting one to their body while in an astral form.
- Below that in a drawer there sit three 1000 gp beautiful red-orange jacinths, beset in three ornately carved silver bars, each worth 100 gp (1100 gp as a set)
- There sits on each altar three skeletal figures - where potentials have been lost to the astral plane.

### Residence Wing
A series of corridoors and rooms belonging to both ministers and those who had come to the synod for "Inauguration". Students have bars on their doors. There is a common room like space. Bones litter the ground.

On the second level there is an ornate large room which belonged to the master of the Synod, [[Marthirion]]. In there exists piles and piles of ruined finery, some burned, some dissolved by something, but all seem to have been dusted down by the flameskulls
### Marthirion's Study
On the second floor above the entrance to the **Blood Pool** at the end of a long corridoor is the study of the late headminiter [[Marthirion]]. Guarding the Chamber will be two of the roaming **Helmed Horrors**, but if the intruders have been spotted, all 5 of the horrors will be present.

##### **Encounter** - Element-Bearer Helmed Horrors
Five **Helmed Horrors** bearing weapons each containing imprisoned **elemental spirits** in gems in the pommels of their weapons
- Each helmed horror has a 5th level *elemental weapon* spell cast on their weapons (+2 to hit, +2d4 damage), one with thunder damage, two with fire, and two with cold.

Imprisoned within the lead horror's weapon is the [[Sylph]] named 

##### Flameskull Monitors - 3 x Flameskulls
Four flameskull servants still roam the synod. One is a failure experiment, and will only fight to defend itself. The other three will attempt to ascertain if the group are allied or not.


##### [[Friendly Flameskull]]
> *Ministers! It is grand to have your attention again! I am certain you will find the Synod up to your standards. Please forgive any of my failures.*



##### Marthirion, Marred by Seeing
