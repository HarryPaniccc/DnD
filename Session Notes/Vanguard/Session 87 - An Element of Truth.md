## Post Mortem

## Introduction 
> *So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light.*

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Rylai Sweetsong]], aided by the [[Vanguard]] and with direction from [[Darius Nubide]], has sought out an ancient ruin - the [[Synod of Elevation]] - where she believes she may find the next step in dispelling her sorcerous magic, and being free of the wounds from her past
- On their journey to the ruin a few hours west of [[Vasspryg]], the group encountered the renowned [[General Isaac]] of the [[Boreal Conclave]], and nearly made a new enemy, but ended up potentially made a new ally. They learnt more about why [[Ulrandir Vanariel]] had not yet been executed, and were told that, in order to get a full story, they must speak with their close ally: [[Alfred Gundrei]].
- Now, having hired a small company of bodyguards, the group set out into the ruin, where, after activating a magical trap and unleashing a type 4 demon in the form of a hidieous Nalfeshnee, the three were teleported to an unknown dungeon location.
- Now, having explored the region somewhat, Rylai was faced with a task of some kind where she had to choose between the three elements of water, air, and fire, representing stillness, freedom, and passion in a way. She chose the elemental shard of fire, and the the chamber began to shift, as a group of elementals, mixed between the elements of water and air, rose up and attacked the group.

## Opening Monologue
> *The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one thing's for certain, you were not expecting to be faced with so personal a trial.*
> 
> *The day is the 29th of Antumbrahn, 813, and you steel yourself to do battle once again. Roll initiative.*

# [[Synod of Elevation]]
---
Needed to add lines to make the section easier to read
### Encounter List
- Elemental ambush with the air and water elementals
- Helmed Horror defensive position with the spells
- Sylph
- Flameskulls
- Friendly flameskull [[Maurice the Flameskull]]
- [[Marthirion|Marthirion, Marred by Seeing]]

### Elemental Essence Chamber
----
Ornate shapes on the walls, depicting various different planes
Four pedistals, one broken, give of a faint light. On the floor, mosaic of the inner planes, depicting the elemental planes. Once the attack of the elementals is triggered, the pedistal with the chosen shard dissolves.

On the second floor, the viewing platform, about 15 ft. above the ground floor, the ornate decorations continue.
- There is an empty armour stand that looks as though it was meant to hold plate armour of some kind
- Four ornate candelabras made of electrum (100 Gp each) sit with candles long since burned away. They are, however, each clearly dusted by someone in the last day or so, as they are cleaner than the environments
- On the walls depict primal elemental forces given vague shapes, with eyes of precious inlayed in the structures.  2 ambers, pearls, sea-green jades and Chrysoberyls (transparent yellow-green) each worth 100 gp.

The top chamber level here leads to the minister's research wing, but the door to it is sealed without a flameskull to assist, as well as the viewing room in the **Wandering Mind Chamber**.

##### **ENCOUNTER** - Water, Air elemental, 3 x  ice mephits
Upon choosing the [[Elemental Essence Shard (Fire)]], Rylai has summoned the contained wrath of the two elementals that remain in the chamber.


### Wandering Self Chamber
---
>*Another dark chamber, built in the same fashion as the Elemental Essence chamber, but decorated differently. Here, shards of what look like dark glass mosaic the floor at the center, giving the impression of a shattered window or mirror. Instead of columns, this room is decorated by four altars, roughly the size of small beds. Surely enough, three of the altars are occupied by pale bodies. At the center of the chamber there sits a pedestal with what appears to be a beautiful dagger held up by a stand. The murals of the walls look like vines or roots or veins, and they give off an illusion of movement as your eye changes focus.*

Here sits destroyed series of four altars meant to seat people's bodies while under the effects of the _astral projection_ spell.

**LOOT**:
- There is, at the end of the room, sitting on an ornate weapon stand, a [[Silver Dagger]], curved and vicious looking, with a ruby set in the pommel. The weapon is a magical tool, meant to sever the *Silver Chord* connecting one to their body while in an astral form. The weapon deals an additional 1d4 psychic damage on hit.
- Below that in a drawer there sit three 1000 gp beautiful red-orange jacinths, beset in three ornately carved silver bars, each worth 100 gp (1100 gp as a set)
- There sits on each altar three skeletal figures - where potentials have been lost to the astral plane.

### Research Wing
---
> *A long, austere hallway is set in stone here. Various embossings decorate the wall, and the ceiling is covered in what looks to be a ruined mural - what elements remain seem to be depicting... a dragon wing here, a thundercloud there... it can't be made out clearly. The hallway curves around to the left at the end of the passage, and halfway along the right wall is a large opening into another chamber.*

A long, austere hallway that wraps around a central scribing room where various scrolls and writings are conducted away from the noise of the rest of the Synod. 

The wing is connected via a secret door to the **minister's study wing**.

In the bottom left corner of the research wing, second closest to the blocked door, the three pious **Flameskulls** have collected a small treasure trove of what, to them, represents things of value that their masters would have left behind that need protecting.
##### [[Maurice the Flameskull]]
> *Ministers! It is grand to have your attention again! I am certain you will find the Synod up to your standards. Please forgive any of my failures.*


### Residence Wing
---
> *This section of the structure reads like a dormitory. Sure enough, peaking into one of the many small rooms, portalled with steel doors, there are ruined shapes of furniture which look to have once been a bed and wardrobe. The same combination of furniture is repeated across four rooms, and at the end of the hallway, a larger group dormitory shares six of these sets. 
> 
> A passage breaking off of the main corridoor leads to a long dining room. Strangely, the table is set with crockery that looks to be mostly destroyed and then re assembled - the pieces of broken plates put back together without glue, piles of glass that could probably be considered the components of cups.*

A series of corridoors and rooms belonging to both ministers and those who had come to the synod for "Inauguration". Students have bars on their doors. There is a common room like space. Bones litter the ground.

On the second level there is an ornate large room which belonged to the master of the Synod, [[Marthirion]]. In there exists piles and piles of ruined finery, some burned, some dissolved by something, but all seem to have been dusted down by the flameskulls.
##### **ENCOUNTER** - 3 x Flameskulls
Four flameskull servants still roam the synod. One is a failure experiment, and will only fight to defend itself. The other three will attempt to ascertain if the group are allied or not.

### Torture Chamber
The torture chamber is outside near the volcano mouth.

### Chamber of Rebirth
---
A chamber where those who fail to prove themselves capable of elevation are brought to the chamber of sacrifice, where they have a hideous ritual performed on their bodies and they are torn apart and transformed into a **Flameskull**.

### Vault of Emergence
---
On the left side, beneath the torture chambers
> Rooms filled with tables of smooth, light stone with depressions in them, cut seemingly so that a body can lie at the centers of them and be supported comfortably. At the center of the room, is what looks to be a slab of cobalt, polished flat on one side, and engraved in writings.

- Something like the corpse of an [[Mistborn Inquisitor Analogue]] guy
- Some kind of experiment on extracting the ability of people to use magic so that those born out of a sorcerer family.

### Minister Research Wing Hallway
---
On the second floor above the entrance to the **Chambers of Rebirth and Emergence** at the end of a long corridoor is the study of the late headminister [[Marthirion]]. Guarding the Chamber will be two of the roaming **Helmed Horrors**, but if the intruders have been spotted, all 5 of the horrors will be present.

##### **ENCOUNTER** - Element-Bearer Helmed Horrors
Five **Helmed Horrors** bearing weapons each containing imprisoned **elemental spirits** in gems in the pommels of their weapons
- Each helmed horror has a 5th level *elemental weapon* spell cast on their weapons (+2 to hit, +2d4 damage), one with thunder damage, two with fire, and two with cold.

**LOOT**
- Each of the horrors bodies are quality plate armour and shields. Their swords are destroyed when the elementals are freed.

Imprisoned within the lead horror's weapon is the [[Sylph]] named [[Eleanor]]. She is good natured, and can sense [[Rylai Sweetsong|Rylai]]'s connection to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].

### Marthirion's Study
---
> *The door opens into a vast stone chamber, more well decorated than any of the others, and seemingly untouched by the damage caused by the denizens of the dungeon. Two raised balconies, one on either side hold bookshelves whose contents look like they may dissolve at a touch. A pair of small, decorative columns sit within the room, their middle sections seemingly shattered and held in place by some unseen magical effect, creating a discontinuity in the structure.
> 
> The contents of the bookshelves appear to be stretched and smeared across the surfaces of the chamber, like putty or paint of a known shape dragged by the hand of a careless child, ruining a clear portrait. In places, the smearing seems to float along river-like shapes, all leading to the center of the room, where, slumped over a reading lecturn amidst a desk covered in a thin, black mass, lies a corpse wearing the tattered remains of a mage's robe.*

Within the head chamber of the Synod there exists a central lecturn, on which is the corpse of Headminister [[Marthirion]], and a single page of the [[Book of Vile Darkness]].

##### **ENCOUNTER** - [[Marthirion, Marred by Seeing]]
Marthirion's statblock is that of a hybrid of 2014 and 2024 [[Mummy Lord]]. Key notes are as follows:
- The 2024 Mummy lord is the base
- Dreadful glare is the 2014 version - **deals no damage**
- Legendary actions are as 2014 version, except the **Attack** legendary action is allows the use of *Channel Negative Energy*.
- No **Whirlwind of Sand** legendary action



# Finding the [[Ley Lines|Ley Line]] Nexus
---
Temple of elemental chaos, Temple to the [[Tharizdun]], [[Tharizdun|Elder Elemental Eye]], has been constructed over a nexus where the four elemental planes cross the [[Material Plane]]. Here, someone attuned to a particular element can connect to that plane and travel through it, but the darkness of the elder god must be disrupted.
- Slaadi
- Gibbering mouthers
- Demons
- Evil elementals

> Goes to a region where there is elemental chaos
> [[Primordials]]/[[Dagon]]?

The Temple was constructed after the [[Age of Wounds]] to honour Tharizdun, but after he was corrupted by [[Dagon]], the god reclaimed it as a temple to elemental evil.

# [[Elemental Plane of Air]]
---
- [[Sylphmade Scarf]]
