## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light.

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Returning from her adventure in [[Sirkonos]] to the familiarity of [[Dularen]], [[Rylai Sweetsong]] has begun to introspect about what her power means for who she is as a person .
- Dedicated to researching methods that will allow her to depart with the part of her magic that represents who she once thought she was meant to be, [[Rylai Sweetsong]] now believes that she has discovered the means of understanding and severing her sorcerous magic: A crossing of the [[Ley Lines]], a [[Ley Nexus]].
- In aid of her persuit, [[Darius Nubide]] pointed her towards a ruin near [[Vasspryg]] that could hold information that may prove valuable for the both of them - a ruin he believes to be the [[Synod of Elevation]].

### Opening Monologue
> The last breath of Autumn grips [[Ruina]]. The landscape surrounding [[Trayfort Keep]] is a vibrant display of colour and metamorphosis. In this realm of ancient histories and calamity, there too exists beauty and calmness. One thing is for certain, Winter is but one week away, and the snowfall has begun to chill your bones.
> 
> The day is the 23rd of *Antumbrahn*, 813 post fall, and you are preparing for another adventure - the first true excursion in a little over a month.

# Session Start

- Some way of determining what kind of elemental crossing she is looking for. Maybe the Ley Line will be used rather to **educate** her goal.
- She needs to go to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] through some kind of portal or by finding a [[Tuning Fork]].
- **Maybe Rylai gives the magic to Lina**
- [[Dusk]] practises blade singing
- [[Isilme Vanariel]] fights her urges, and we learn more from [[Smudge]]

## Notes for reference
### Darius' Offer to Rylai
"There is much outside of official capacity that I desire, and though the loyalties of the sentinels are unquestionable, much of my resources are predisposed. West of Vasspryg there lies a ruin believed to be a center of research for the old Ruinan Tyranny. I believe it to be the Synod of Elevation, a once sacred place where those who were unable to prove their connection to their lineages were given one final chance to snap into their heritage of power, or be cast from their position in the sorcerer king's society. It has been probed by arcanist historians and treasure hunters for some time, but I have always suspected that there was something that everyone else had missed, hidden within that ruin. **If anywhere of old Ruina held the location of a Ley Line Nexus it would be there.**"

"What I require in exchange for this information is information: Any understanding of magic and what would cause it to flow or cease within an individual that is housed there. The understanding that they had of how the weave has enlightened much of our own, and expansion is of great interest to me."
### Rylai's Study Infodump
>*These readings come as a result of days of regular reading. The information here is drip fed to you after exhaustive dismissal of texts unrelated to your research, until finally you identify the form of the theory you are working on.*
>
>*"Magic comes from the Weave, or... the Weave comes from magic. The exact order of dependency is always up for debate, but numerous models have shown to both be accurate and consistent in producing spells, while also being completely contradictory to other, equally accurate models. Song, for instance, is able to create spells, words and tunes forming harmonies that meld the weave and shape it to the artist's will. Sometimes magic requires a great deal of mental effort, some sorcerer children being born able to, through extreme concentration, move an apple with a rudimentary telekinesis spell, not understanding why, and breaking the rules that many models propose. One concept seems somewhat consistent." at least for what you are looking for. "Magic is often tied to something. Words, knowledge, effort, music, elements and planes, bloodlines, history, true names of things, even blessings. Mastery of these connections, "Paths to power", is what makes mages more powerful, but not necessarily more knowledgeable. It often takes a great deal of effort for one to learn another of these techniques; a "Namer" for example will have trouble dismissing the Onomantic axioms they have learned if they try to learn to cast spells they already know through sigil magic..." Discussions and musings like this continue for volumes and volumes. It would take years for you to get to what you need while also understanding it to a useful extent.*
>
> *Your research takes you to a familiar, comfortable line of study. History. If there is something you know, those that lived in the ages past where Ruina now sits had mastery and understanding of magic. One topic is well known in ancient Ruinan lore. It was an empire. Part of Thay, perhaps in its early formations, but at some point it split from the Thayan government, forming its own sect. And it was evil. That much you knew from your adventure hunting down the resurrected Knights of Malevolence. They were preparing for war. And they wanted to return their king to life. Important to your research, a tidbit you may have ignored if not for you astuteness, is their obsession with understanding the Weave of Magic, and the primal magical forces of this world. Its a throwaway note on an old volume, but it leads you to believe that maybe even over academic arcane study, lore may be able to guide you once again.*
>
>DC 15
>*Another trait that is linked to how this lost empire functioned is its obsession with dragons and draconic culture. Language, artworks of the great beasts, and even, supposedly, their military was linked in some way to dragons and their power. It was no surprise then that they were looked upon favourably by Tiamat, but whether that favour came as a result of their reverence, or their reverence gave them that favour. One thing was certain, their reverence extended, too, to sorcerers. In fact, where Thay was known to be a magocracy, led by their Red Wizards and their Zulkirs in Desseran before the empire fell, Ruina was the home to a sorcerer supremist cult. If you were not born with magic, you did not deserve it. If you were, you were meant to rule and do as you pleased with the world.*

>DC 20
>*You find yourself reading a translation of an old scroll, preserved in glass and kept hidden from the sun and moisture by layers of basement. "Power", the translation reads, "often requires suffering to access. How many sorcerers are born but never discover their true purpose? Certainly never in the population of the workers" - a footnote mentions that the word "worker" and "slave" are the same in this language - "would we expect someone to discover power. But... sometimes the elevation is not easily known in the children of our subjects. Those born seemingly un-elevated should not necessarily never have the opportunity to prove their holy right. Thus, as of Reign 477" - another note, years since their emperor came into power - "those born to elevated parents must be given the opportunity to blossom their abilities. Power, often requires suffering to access. If that fails, the un-elevated children of elevated parents must not be allowed to extend their failure to their bloodline." The translation ends.*


# Ruin Approach
---
- two hours west of [[Vasspryg]]
## Approach the Ruin
A ruin that is overgrown with moss and other flora, growing out of the side of a mountain, the structure would have likely been regal in its prime, but what remains appears to be three distinct ruins.

The base of a watchtower, its upper floors having crumbled mostly inwards, but the rubble has been moved to next to the structure. Behind that, in a courtyard of some sorts, what looks like it might have once been a temple, too, sits ruined. Behind that sits the most well-preserved of the structures. A series of 5 arches, some 10 to 15 feet high, arcs around the entrance to a structure that stretches out in either direction for a small distance. Above the ground floor of the main structure, evidence of windows and an upper structure remains, but other than the ground floor, everything seems to be in as bad condition as the rest of the ruin.
### Ruined Watchtower

### Inner Sanctum and Hidden Portal
The singular chamber that is most intriguing to the players is a sanctum of sorts. On the far wall sits a mural of a pair of dragons bowing to a man whose facial features are replaced with what looks like a smoothe, almost glass-like surface.

- As a character passes near the mural, they sense a probing sensation, like someone pushing against you to see if you will stay standing or be moved back, but testing not your body, but your will. A character who can cast spells can attempt a DC 20 ability check using their spellcasting ability to try to gain control of the door, or, if the character is a sorcerer, may attempt a DC 10 check.
- As a character reaches out with their will, they feel another presence grow and begin to push against them, as if discovering an intruder trying to open a door.
- Once a character has succeeded a check to manipulate an element of the Synod, they may use an action to control a part of the deeper synod structure's main mechanisms.
#### Encounter: Nalfeshnee
When a character pushes against the mural for the first time, the magic of the structure summons a **Nalfeshnee demon**, bound in a magic circle somewhere in the structure

After defeating the demon, the party will be teleported to the synod
# [[Synod of Elevation]]

## The Facility - First Level
The portal opens into an open chamber of stone, tiered, with what appears to be a balcony of sorts cut one layer. The ceiling of the central chamber is high, maybe 50 ft up. There are six pathways on the ground floor: Two left, two right, and two forward
### Residence Wing
A series of corridoors and rooms belonging to both ministers and those who had come to the synod for "Inauguration". Students have bars on their doors. There is a common room like space. Bones litter the ground.
### Research Wing
### Elemental Essence Chamber
Ornate shapes on the walls, depicting various different planes
Four pedistals, one broken, give of a faint light. On the floor, mosaic of the inner planes, depicting the elemental planes.

**Rylai feels a connection** to the three pedistals, and the shards on each of them
- Water shard is cold. Stillness. In it she finds dullness, the ability to hide from her pain, but also the loss of passion
- Fire shard is anguish. Power and frustration, but also love. Warmth. You realize just how familiar the feeling is, and how much you long for the cold to disipate, but also how much you fear it.
- Air shard you feel as you are. You feel a reflection of yourself. Less modified by your past or how you chose to deal with it, you feel in the air shard there is truth. It merely enhances the effects of the fire or water shards

Depending on what Rylai chooses, she will gain one of the following
- [[Elemental Essence Shard (Water)]]
- [[Elemental Essence Shard (Fire)]]
- [[Elemental Essence Shard (Air)]]

The two she did not choose will summon an elemental of each type, and two mephits of the combination of them.
## Second Level
### Vault of Emergence
On the left side, beneath the torture chambers
> Rooms filled with tables of smooth, light stone with depressions in them, cut seemingly so that a body can lie at the centers of them and be supported comfortably. At the center of the room, is what looks to be a slab of cobalt, polished flat on one side, and engraved in writings.

- Something like the corpse of an [[Mistborn Inquisitor Analogue]] guy
- Some kind of experiment on extracting the ability of people to use magic so that those born out of a sorcerer family.

### Chamber of Sacrifice
A chamber where those who fail to prove themselves capable of elevation are brought to the chamber of sacrifice, where they have a hideous ritual performed on their bodies and they are torn apart and transformed into a **Flameskull**.

### Vault of 
### Knowing Fool
Mummy lord fight but themed like a man maddened by knowledge
