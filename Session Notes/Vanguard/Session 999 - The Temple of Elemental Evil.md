## Post Mortem

## Introduction
> Swallow and take what you thought you were meant to be. Reconcile it with who you are. Another lesson learned in time. But oh, you'll find.
> 
> You don't know who you are until you are lost.

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past decades, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- As a child, Rylai Sweetsong danced with the elements and conducted magics with a keen attunement, the likes of which rivalled by few at such a young age.
- One fateful night, however, while trying to push herself beyond her abilities, acting on an impulse of jealousy and a feeling of inferiority, a fatal accident would take everything from the young halfling, leaving her orphaned and burned.
- Rylai would recoil from the flames, unable to face the heat, and froze her heart, and her connection to her magic faded with time. She travelled, hoping to see the world and what the realm had to offer, but she also spent that time running. Hiding.
- Now, inspired by the growth of her friends and found family, the Vanguard, and given the strength to decide for herself, she, aided by the [[Sylph]] [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]], has come to a place of elemental power, lost to time, where she may finally find answers to the questions she has been unable to ask herself.
- It is here, as she plunges into the darkness of the [[Temple of Elemental Evil]], alone except for the laughing light that is her new friend Ophelia, that Rylai readies herself to face the challenges that the future holds, and the scars that the past has left to fester.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are the first person to step foot along the path you tread in a long, long time.
> 
> The day is the 3rd of *Dul'ussahn*, 813, and you feel almost abuzz with magic, covered head to toe in wards and protection.

# Session TODO
Rylai pushes into the sealed [[Temple of Elemental Evil]], hoping to acquire access to the [[Ley Nexus]] present there that will allow her to access her magic more directly and purge her sorcerous powers.

Recall that the guardian outside warned of a great evil contained within the temple, something that he could allow no one to pass who would let it escape. Something eternal.

- Flashback for Rylai's Past
- Combat encounter x 2?
- Sneaking around maybe?
- [[Sylphmade Cloak]]

### Encounters/Monsters Ideas
> Want to use aberrations, fiends and elementals
- Gibbering Mouther (FM! Seems more fun), or modify it to Daze
- Earth elemental of some kind, maybe a Xorn or with the earth elemental companion abilities
- **ABOLETH**

>[!Idea] Mirroring
>Flashbacks should mirror/give some hint as to what each room should be?

### 5-room dungeon


# The Descent | Entrance and Guardian
---
### Flashback
> You are 

### Descent through Darkness
> Pushing through a miasma of shadow, light from Ophelia barely illuminating your way, the pathway finally smoothes out. Rocky crags morph into ramped cave floor, and eventually again into mostly ruined masonry. After stepping carefully through the darkness of a crevasse that would be tight for someone of greater stature, a chamber is revealed.
> 
> One lined with upright stone figures.

The chamber is vast, some fourty feet square with a pair of giant stone doors at the end, rimmed by a chain-like mechanism. In front of the door, lining to floors.

- The remains bear a resemblance to humans in height. There are maybe 50 of them will be clustered together in the centre of the room. 

##### Balconies
There is a balcony at the top left wall facing inwards, and a second that has collapsed along the right wall. 

- **Investigation 15** on the collapsed balcony's rubble will reveal a chamber beyond will reveal something
- The top left balcony leads to a small square chamber


# [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]]
---
Ophelia understands the history of the temple of elements before [[Tharizdun]] fell to the influence of the [[Seed of the Abyss]].

>[!Note] Why did she come with?
>Ophelia can understand the wound that Rylai has inflicted on herself, and she does not want her to continue to suffer. She believes that the only way for her to interact with her connection to the elemental planes is to understand her pain. You can't cut out a tumour if you dont understand it.
>
>Ophelia truly wants Rylai to embrace her connection to the elemental plane of air.

# Antechamber
---
> I can feel the movements of the stones beneath you, tiny one. My siblings are blind, and slumber, and the wind conceals your movement, but the stones do not lie. You are new here, and of the new world.

A particularly evil earth elemental notices Rylai's presence with his tremorsense, but he will not alert the rest of the temple, as he believes that if he kills her he can use the power of her blood to escape his confinement. Rylai holds the power to open a sealed rift to the elemental planes, and can also step through the veil of the temple's imprisonment.

##### **ENCOUNTER:** 3 x Gargoyles


# The [[Elemental Plane of Air]] (Halfway Point)
