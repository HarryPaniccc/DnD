**GENERAL NOTES**
- Time is 11:00 on Banahras 2nd. The party are at the [[Itchy Foot Inn]], Skye is doing homework and Caede and Arthur are on their way west of the city to meet with the battalion of reinforcements
- The weather is sunny and will hold for a few days

# The Encampment of the Silver Arrow
The battalion under [[Syr Emelia Richstrahd]] is the [[Battalion of the Silver Arrow]], consisting of rangers and soldiers who are sent around the region surrounding [[Mount Ethris]] as one of the most active Kronesguard forces.

- During the ride, Arthur will ask Caede how about their exploits at [[Kenifria]], and make other small talk

> Your path takes you off a road and through a small thicket of trees, growing darker and more forest-like with each passing minute, though there is a trail that Arthur points out to you. After riding for another few minutes, the thick trees overhead creating a protective layer from the sun above, you come around a corner where the path is surrounded by spiked barricades. A pair of soldiers, armoured in dark leather and breastplates, wielding crossbows, note your approach, and train their weapons on you. Behind them there is a fortified encampment of tents and fires and soldiers going about their business, on patrol, cooking rations and tending to their horses and their gear, banners of the Crown flying overhead

- The armoured Kronesguard that note the approach will need to be reasoned with to gain entrance to the camp: *Christoph* and *Oliver* are their names, and both are rangers
- Caede and the prince will receive strange stares
  
- [[Syr Emelia Richstrahd]] can be found sparring with her subordinates. They will be unarmored and she will be 1v2ing two larger men. Her agility in combat is her advantage, she is actually quite short, but clearly very strong, and outmaneuvers her opponents. She knocks one down and is then in a short moment of opening is forced into submission with a blade to her neck

**What Emelia knows**
- The Silver Arrow Battalion can be mobilized in two hours. They will be able to the Vanguard where they are needed
- Travel to the region on the borders of Sirkonos will be faster if they stay off the roads. The rangers and scouts of the Silver Arrow will make quick work of pathfinding a good route, so long as the Vanguard point them in a good direction.
- It is advantageous to go off road to avoid roadside regiments
- It will take the Battalion roughly 4 days of off-road travel to reach [[Strahldale]]
- There are banners of both the royal insignia of Sirkonos, and an arrow facing downwards, splitting a shield.
# Travel North
Camping with the Battalion is a totally different affair compared to camping as a group.
- The Vanguard will need to help map a trail ahead of the main party. A group DC 10 survival check will cause the battalion to move at a normal pace for a day.

> Travelling with a band of over a hundred horses is 

- The general calls for camp to be set up before sunset each day, after about 7 hours of travel. 
## Campsites
- (Day 2) **Rocky bluffs overlooking a river** On the pathway through a tight ravine overlooking a small river, there sits a series of layered rocky bluffs overlooking a river of clear water.
- **Shattered Bridge** Some distance into the [[Miletohr Wilds]] there lies an ancient pathway that has fallen out of use. The pathway leads past a series of glades and eventually to a large river, where sits the remains of a wide stone bridge. **While camping in this region, the group will overhear talk of doubts in the soldiers under their command**

> *"We are being led northward to face an army that was supposedly responsible for wiping out the Einzberns. I do not doubt our command or our tactics, and our firepower is not something that can be scoffed at, but I know a powerful enemy when I see one. And that bird. Talons like blades and eyes like red stars."*
> 
> *"This so called prince comes into camp, talks up the general, and suddenly, days later, we move away from our monthlong post chasing the very force we have been commanded by Sir Renslayer himself not to engage with. Not to mention we are being led by a band of mercenaries. I don't doubt our mission, but I wonder if Syr Richstrahd is being properly informed, or if she isn't bewitched."*
> 
> *"The thought of breaking the Kingdom's era of peace is what is shaking me. We will be the first mobilized Kronesguard in hundreds of years to march and meet an invading force that poses an existential threat to the King and his people. I am not afraid. It is an honor to be the head of the spear that strikes at Sirkonos' enemies. But I can't help but feel that this is a bad omen. An omen for darker days to come."*

If the party hear two or more of the conversations, Syr Richstrahd will come up to them to address them, saying that her men have faced orc tribes descending from the north, pirate raiders from the southern seas, and dragon cultists, not to mention the horrors of the wastes.
- She will desire that they spend time planning their next steps
- She will know about [[Strahldale]] up ahead, and will suggest that the battalion resupplies and rests there
- If she hears about the farmers being sacrificed, she will assume that Strahldale has fallen
## Strategies
