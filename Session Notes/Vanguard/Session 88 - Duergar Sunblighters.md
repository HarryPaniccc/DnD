## Introduction
---
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light.

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Kanan Einzbern]] and [[Caede]], chosen of [[The Raven Queen]], are on a long and arduous quest in search of the great Dwarven city of the [[Maghlas Mountains]], [[Steinwalde]],
- On their journey they have encountered numerous foes and strange allies: An [[Erinyes]] by the name of [[Odessa]], the legendary monster hunter [[Rudolph van Richten]], a scout by the name of [[Belle Nierhund]] who Kanan offered a spot in the [[Battalion of the Silver Arrow]], as well as facing down winter wolves, frost giants, and now Duergar.
- Having ascended a massive ancient highway stretching around one of the peaks in this frigid, shattered wasteland, the group came across a group of dwarven prostpectors from the [[Battlehammer Clan]], four dwarf scouts: [[Olunt]], [[Kalanor]], [[Morgrail]] and their leader, [[Zeb]]. 
- Now, faced with the first of the Sunblight clan's guards, Caede and Kanan have engaged with a battlement in the early hours of the morning some time before sunrise.
### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are stone and frost. Permanent and more ancient that you likely can understand. A river of stone flows beneath your feet into the distance both ahead and behind you, and one thing is for certain: This is but the first of your battles this day.
> 
> The day is the 4th of Dulussahn, 813, and you grasp your weapons tightly as the smell of blood takes to the frigid air, and the Sunblight clan's sentries fight to repel your assault.

# Session Start
Travelling the [[Faults of North Estravia]]
- Duergar tower and Sunblight clan are in their way.
- The road carries on for some time before levelling out
- Travel montage for expediency. It takes 4-5 days of hard movement to get to where theyve gotta go. Maybe do an encounter 
# Sunblight Guards
---
During the daylight hours, the duergar defences are weakened: A fact that they are well aware of. The duergar have employed bugbears to aid in defending the entrance to their cave region during the daylight hours, but those hours have grown incredibly short in the arctic areas.

As winter has set in entirely, the time the sun will be up is only around 6 hours, from 9 am to 3 pm. This gives a tight window for the party to swing by in a safer manner.

##### **Encounter:** Sunblighter Guard Post
Wrap up what we were doing
**Loot**: Each duergar has a healing potion on them, and there are two more in a chest inside of the battlement.

##### **Encounter:** Response to Attack
If the group fail to hide that they made it past and the Duergar realize what is happening they will send four duergar and the duergar mind mage (17 AC from **Black Ice Halfplate**) to inspect.

##### **Encounter:** Sunblighter Crane Fortress
The combat will have different enemies depending on whether they manage to not raise the alarm.
> The road beyond the battlement wraps a good distance before coming to a squat, square structure hanging off of the edge of the road. Torches are lit in the courtyard surrounding it, and opposite it, going up the mountain, another dual set of battlements guard a huge passage deeper into the mountain. Hanging off the balcony beyond the edge of the wall is a large crane lift, drawn by large beasts of burden.
> 
> A roofed off courtyard passageway cuts through the squat fortress structure with portcullises currently down.

- One Bugbear on either side of the fortresses passageway above the portcullis on a balcony
- Five Duergar in the chamber adjacent to the passage
- A Duergar Mind Mage in half plate (17 AC) in a study overlooking the area
- (If alert) five more duergar and two stone guards

##### **Encounter:** Frostcleaver
The Adult White dragon Frostcleaver will be surveying the area if they flee with reason to be hunted.

# Into the Rift
---
[[Lathran Murke]]'s memories guide Kanan to where his resting place is, the little dome of life, three skeletons surrounding his who holds his staff that has created a permanent _Tiny Hut_ spell. Ahead will be the entrance to a hallowed ground, that Van Richten will need to unlock:
> Something esoteric I guess
##### **Encounter**: Waves of Ghoul Minions and normal Ghouls
From the mists of the caverns, [[Merideth, the Bheur Hag]], will send her "puppies" to feast on whoever is lost down here.

# The Ride out of the Chasms
---
>The road out of the chasms 

The group will have a relatively calm time as they reach the end of the chasms, but up ahead will be a battle between the Flamebrands and the young red dragon.
