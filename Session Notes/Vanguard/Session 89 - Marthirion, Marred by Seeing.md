## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light.

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past days, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Attempting to find a way to remove the ties she has to her sorcerous magic, [[Rylai Sweetsong]] has lead the [[Vanguard]] to the [[Synod of Elevation]], an ancient ruin where sorcery was studied by the [[Old Ruinan Empire]].
- Here, the group have battled their way through magical defenses, facing demonic and elemental powers, as well as a group of mad flameskulls, who used to be servants who operated in the Synod. One of the flameskulls, [[Maurice the Flameskull]], seems to have confused the group for minsters of the Synod, and has been aiding them in navigating the ruin.
- With Maurice's guide, the party made their way towards the study of the headminister of the Synod, [[Marthirion]], and did battle with the reconstituted flameskull servants, as well as a collection of Helmed Horrors, wielding elementally enhanced swords.
- Once the defences had been dealt with, the group freed an elemental spirit that was trapped in the blade of one of the constructs, who identified herself as [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]]. As the group saw to their wounds and prepared to enter into the main office, where they may find the information Rylai seeks, the elemental seemed to see something within Rylai, questioning her about her true goals, but not revealing much more.
- Our heroes made their way into the large stone chamber and found it in a state of esoteric chaos, the very knowledge from the surrounding books stretching through space and being absorbed by a terrible page on the central dias. After Dusk cast a translation spell on the page, and once the knowledge of a single word took root in her mind, the corpse of Marthirion jerked awake, and let out a fell screech.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are warped, the fabric of the contents of shelves stretched and almost flowing like liquid towards the centre of the room. One thing is for certain though, you are no longer alone.
> 
> The day is the 29th of *Antumbrahn*, 813, and the shadows recoil around you as a surge of arcane energy pulses from the form of [[Marthirion|Marthirion, Marred by Seeing]], as he is raised into the air of the chamber.

# TODO list
- Marthirion encounter
- Find information useful to Darius, but nothing about how Rylai can do her thing. No 
- Go to torture chamber to see the [[Mistborn Inquisitor Analogue]]
- Ophelia leads them to a [[Ley Nexus]]

# Marthirion, Marred by Seeing
---
> *The door opens into a vast stone chamber, more well decorated than any of the others, and seemingly untouched by the damage caused by the denizens of the dungeon. Two raised balconies, one on either side hold bookshelves whose contents look like they may dissolve at a touch. A pair of small, decorative columns sit within the room, their middle sections seemingly shattered and held in place by some unseen magical effect, creating a discontinuity in the structure.
> 
> The contents of the bookshelves appear to be stretched and smeared across the surfaces of the chamber, like putty or paint of a known shape dragged by the hand of a careless child, ruining a clear portrait. In places, the smearing seems to float along river-like shapes, all leading to the center of the room, where, slumped over a reading lecturn amidst a desk covered in a thin, black mass, lies a corpse wearing the tattered remains of a mage's robe.*

Within the head chamber of the Synod there exists a central lecturn, on which is the corpse of Headminister [[Marthirion]], and a single page of the [[Book of Vile Darkness]] containing the name [[Dagon]].

##### **ENCOUNTER** - [[Marthirion, Marred by Seeing]]

Marthirion's statblock is a sorcerer-ified Mummy Lord statblock. His INT, WIS and CHA stats are just shifted to the right (WIS = 11, CHA = 18, INT = 16)
- He can use 2 legendary actions to cast a spell from staff of the void, or one to reuse *Void Strike*.
- He has the _shield_ spell and will cast only that and through the staff of the void

>[!If Rylai Goes Down]
>At last you feel the coldness envelope you comepletely. No more motion, no more pain from memory or truth, no more fear of consequence or the future. Just an icy, eternal, still winter that has fallen on your frozen heart. Peace at last. Nothingness. 
>
>And for a moment, you want it. Until across the frigid landscape of the you that can no longer feel... a gentle wind blows. Not a gale. Not a storm. But a breath. Motion of more than just the body. Life. Freedom. 
>
>The wind carries your name. But it also carries pain. Memory and truth. Love. The wind has been with you for your entire journey. Around you and within you.
>
>And now it pushes you onwards, towards truth.

>[!Loot]
>Marthirion's [[Staff of the Void]] will drop when he falls, as well as his heart.
### Developments: Defeating Marthirion
When marthirion is defeated, his heart will fall to the ground. This is the piece required to reach the final chambers of the [[Synod of Elevation]], which contains the vault of emergence.
# Within Marthirion's Study
---
Many of the books of the surround have been destroyed or "stretched" by [[Dagon]]'s influence on the surrounds, but the [[Page of Vile Darkness]] remains intact and within Dusk's grasp.

[[Maurice the Flameskull]] will note that with Marthirion's essence, his **heart**, the group can make it into the vault of emergence.
# Within the Vault of Emergence
---
Three rooms are present in a cross shape, to the left is the chamber of rebirth, the right is the enhanced torture chamber, and to the middle is the Vault of Emergence.

>[!Loot]
>A scroll of *Modify Memory* has fallen to the ground.


> Rooms filled with tables of smooth, light stone with depressions in them, cut seemingly so that a body can lie at the centers of them and be supported comfortably. At the center of the room, is what looks to be a slab of cobalt, polished flat on one side, and engraved in writings. Next to it are two stone lecturns on either side, each with a book closed atop them, and lying in front of it is the body of a man.

### Relentless Juggernaut Corpse
The creature has had lines of thick [[Runite]] traced along its form. A stake of runite, about 3/4 of a meter long, has been plunged through the creature's form. A trail of darkened stone and mold leads from one of the tables to where it lies.

Its eyes have been replaced with pools of once molten metal.
### Cobalt Slab
The slab is written in the old ruinan tongue, a language that uses the draconic script but is known by [[Darius Nubide]]. It contains intricate arcane methods and processes used to extract power from a being and transfer it to another.
- The alchemical symbol for [[Runite]] is emblazoned on the face of the slab.

### Books
More text written in the old ruinan tongue, the works appear to be lab notes intersperced with more cleanly written instructions. 
- The first book contains a well written series of notes on Necromancy, and also contains the rites of creation of a [[Flameskull]]
- The second appears to be various methods of prodding the soul using the physical body. Various biological diagrams are traced out with organs and bones and other such pieces of the body noted with annotations, usually requiring some kind of severance or stimulation.
- The third and fourth appear to be [[Marthirion]]'s experimentation notes, in which he has spent time working on various methods of combining the essences of multiple failed sorcerer children who came to the Synod into a single form, so that they might become one powerful being that may be of use above that of a flameskull.

# Ophelia's Help
---
Ophelia will be able to tell the party that she knows where she might find something that is probably a ley nexus: One that has caused a planar crossing the the plane of elemental plane of air.
