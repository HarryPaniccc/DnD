**GENERAL NOTES**
- Banahras 5th
- Amidst the [[Battle of Strahldale]]
- Time right now is around 10:00 am. The vanguard press deeper into the main hall of Lucius' castle, while the battle outside moves inward and the [[Battalion of the Silver Arrow]], led by [[Syr Emelia Richstrahd]] set up a defensive line and barricade the doors.

**IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER**
- Isilme wants to do her thing
- Kanan wants to trap Athelstan in the goblet
- Skye is tripping
- Eren wants the chalice
- Arthur is ~~that~~
- [[Aerondite]] and [[Siegfried Einzbern]] and the spirits of the other [[Einzberns]]
## Hallway Defense Position
Syr Richstrahd and her battalion move in to the hallway to set up an emergency position. With control of the inner halls, as well as with [[Borovik]] on their side, they are able to take advantage of the castle's defenses, as well as the unpreparedness of their opponents, to shut off the outsides.
### Prince Arthur, and Eren
Amidst the barking of orders and chaos the vanguard will spot a familiar face and a familiar head of golden hair. Dismounting his mud-covered warhorse and wiping someone else's blood from his rapier, Prince Arthur Sirkon approaches you with a stern look on his eyes.
- **DC 10 Insight** shows that something is different from the boy that they met months ago in an inn
- The half orc raider knight that fought alongside the vanguard will identify himself as Syr Mikael
## The Tangled Descent
The balcony to the rear of the castle overlooks the massive tunnel that had been dug, out of which a pillar of dark red, infernal light spews. Around the tunnel, three dark, metallic claws rotate, nearly 5 storeys tall and channeling the dark energy of the pit.

The descent into the pit is overgrown and entangled with massive roots and vines, dark in colour, and at the tips of the vines, appear to enter into the border ethereal. 
- **A DC 15 arcana check** recognises that these vines are a part of the feywild and are linked here through the ethereal plane
- Descending the tangled growth of vines requires a **DC 10 athletics check**. No vines are too distant from one another, but the first 35ft or so down the hole has no pathway down, and must be scaled or flown by as the wall is a sheer face of dirt and rock
- Failing the check causes a character to succeed a DC 12 acrobatics check or suffer 2d6 bludgeoning damage as the slip and fall down

> *As you descend further down. Down. Down into the depths. Helping one another when footing becomes difficult. Treading carefully when slippery moss takes underfoot, the energy around you grows with each passing meter of depth you continue down. One, two, five hundred feet you descend. You pick up the pace. You fall and clamber and scrape your hands and bang your knees and crawl down into the depths of the Ethfalian caverns, until a massive collection of roots below form a pathway that can not be descended down any further, but can be followed. Ahead, the glow of the crystal lights of the Ethfalian caverns, and the broken wall of a yet-unexplored wing of [[Kenifria]]*

## Return To Kenifria
As the pathway continues onwards, the way shows signs of cult activity recently, but the region appears abandoned. 
- DC 15 Arcana check identifies alchemical instruments, as well arcane inscribing stations used in the ritual process
- The pathway is direct and straight, taking you through a back courtyard which opens up to reveal the beautiful crystals above, lighting the region
## Elandra's Lair
The room was once a worship space, perhaps an altar room dedicated to a knight of some kind. Now, red flames flicker in ensconced torches lining the walls, as well as candles layered over the ground. The area smells of perfume and blood and lavender. As you approach, Elandra's voice echoes throughout the chamber coming from the long shadows cast by the candlelight.
