## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Returning from her adventure in [[Sirkonos]] to the familiarity of [[Dularen]] Rylai has begun to introspect about what her power means for who she is as a person 
- Dedicated to researching methods that will allow her to depart with the part of her magic that represents who she once thought she was meant to be, [[Rylai Sweetsong]] now believes that she has discovered the means of understanding her sorcerous magic: A [[Ley Lines|Ley Line]].
- Seeking a Ley Line she blah blah #TODO

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).


# Session Start

- Some way of determining what kind of elemental crossing she is looking for. Maybe the Ley Line will be used rather to **educate** her goal.
- She needs to go to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] through some kind of portal or by finding a [[Tuning Fork]].
- **Maybe Rylai gives the magic to Lina**
### Rylai's Study Infodump
>*These readings come as a result of days of regular reading. The information here is drip fed to you after exhaustive dismissal of texts unrelated to your research, until finally you identify the form of the theory you are working on.*

>*"Magic comes from the Weave, or... the Weave comes from magic. The exact order of dependency is always up for debate, but numerous models have shown to both be accurate and consistent in producing spells, while also being completely contradictory to other, equally accurate models. Song, for instance, is able to create spells, words and tunes forming harmonies that meld the weave and shape it to the artist's will. Sometimes magic requires a great deal of mental effort, some sorcerer children being born able to, through extreme concentration, move an apple with a rudimentary telekinesis spell, not understanding why, and breaking the rules that many models propose. One concept seems somewhat consistent." at least for what you are looking for. "Magic is often tied to something. Words, knowledge, effort, music, elements and planes, bloodlines, history, true names of things, even blessings. Mastery of these connections, "Paths to power", is what makes mages more powerful, but not necessarily more knowledgeable. It often takes a great deal of effort for one to learn another of these techniques; a "Namer" for example will have trouble dismissing the Onomantic axioms they have learned if they try to learn to cast spells they already know through sigil magic..." Discussions and musings like this continue for volumes and volumes. It would take years for you to get to what you need while also understanding it to a useful extent.*

> *Your research takes you to a familiar, comfortable line of study. History. If there is something you know, those that lived in the ages past where Ruina now sits had mastery and understanding of magic. One topic is well known in ancient Ruinan lore. It was an empire. Part of Thay, perhaps in its early formations, but at some point it split from the Thayan government, forming its own sect. And it was evil. That much you knew from your adventure hunting down the resurrected Knights of Malevolence. They were preparing for war. And they wanted to return their king to life. Important to your research, a tidbit you may have ignored if not for you astuteness, is their obsession with understanding the Weave of Magic, and the primal magical forces of this world. Its a throwaway note on an old volume, but it leads you to believe that maybe even over academic arcane study, lore may be able to guide you once again.*

>*Another trait that is linked to how this lost empire functioned is its obsession with dragons and draconic culture. Language, artworks of the great beasts, and even, supposedly, their military was linked in some way to dragons and their power. It was no surprise then that they were looked upon favourably by Tiamat, but whether that favour came as a result of their reverence, or their reverence gave them that favour. One thing was certain, their reverence extended, too, to sorcerers. In fact, where Thay was known to be a magocracy, led by their Red Wizards and their Zulkirs in Desseran before the empire fell, Ruina was the home to a sorcerer supremist cult. If you were not born with magic, you did not deserve it. If you were, you were meant to rule and do as you pleased with the world.*

>*You find yourself reading a translation of an old scroll, preserved in glass and kept hidden from the sun and moisture by layers of basement. "Power", the translation reads, "often requires suffering to access. How many sorcerers are born but never discover their true purpose? Certainly never in the population of the workers" - a footnote mentions that the word "worker" and "slave" are the same in this language - "would we expect someone to discover power. But... sometimes the elevation is not easily known in the children of our subjects. Those born seemingly un-elevated should not necessarily never have the opportunity to prove their holy right. Thus, as of Reign 477" - another note, years since their emperor came into power - "those born to elevated parents must be given the opportunity to blossom their abilities. Power, often requires suffering to access. If that fails, the un-elevated children of elevated parents must not be allowed to extend their failure to their bloodline." The translation ends.*

# [[Synod of Elevation]]
---

West of [[Vasspryg]] lies the entrance to a ruined research facility. The structure is housed comfortably within a cave which is accessible by a small crack which can be squeezed through with some effort. Beyond sits a large door constructed of stone sitting against the walls of a large structure built into the cave wall, clearly made of stone cut from elsewhere. A runed groove runs along the outer face of the door, which stands half opened, faintly glowing with the blue magic used to open and close it.

- As a character passes near the door, they sense a probing sensation, like someone pushing against you to see if you will stay standing or be moved back, but testing not your body, but your will. A character can attempt a DC 20 ability check using their spellcasting ability to try to gain control of the door, or, if the character is a sorcerer, may attempt a DC 10 check.
- Once a character has succeeded a check to manipulate an element of the Synod, they may use an action to control a part of the structure.

### Chambers of Emergence
> Rooms filled with tables of smooth, light stone with depressions in them, cut seemingly so that a body can lie at the centers of them and be supported comfortably. 

- West of [[Vasspryg]] there's a ruined research facility dedicated to bringing out magical powers in people, looking to ascend them to incredible power.
- Something like the corpse of an [[Mistborn Inquisitor Analogue]] guy
- Some kind of experiment on extracting the ability of people to use magic so that those born out of a sorcerer family.
- Location has been visited recently
- Vault with writing from the [[Book of Vile Darkness]]
