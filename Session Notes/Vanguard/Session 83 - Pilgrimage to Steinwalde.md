## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- With the evil of the [[Vorciln]] defeated, [[Kanan Einzbern]] now is left with the burden of the [[Vessel of Avarice]]. 
- Inside it is trapped [[Athelstan]], the source of the curse of his family that has persisted for thousands of years.
- Now, determined to create a permanent solution to the dangers that he has been intrusted with by the Vanguard, and with the objectives of improving his gear, Kanan plans to take one of the hardest pilgrimages known to his people; he plans to journey to the distant dwarven kingdom of [[Steinwalde]], hidden for millennia, deep in the ranges of the [[Maghlas Mountains]].

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are well tended and comfortable. Servants eagerly help your preparations, loading up your horse for the long journey ahead. One thing is for certain though, the air grows colder as the winter sets in.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are excited for the journey ahead.

# Session Start

- Adventure into the Hells

# Departure from Keldmire
---
> Heading East the well-worn but well maintained road sweeps dramatically ahead of you, cutting first through farmland, and then later over low-lying hills. After an hour or so of riding you have already left behind the [[Keldmire]] orchards and farm houses. Lanterns become rarer to see along the side of the roads, and once or twice you pass by ruined keeps and castles, one even seems to be reduced to just a pile of stone and a few walls.
> 
> After hours of riding, you come round a bend, the path ahead of you obscured by light woodland, and begin riding alongside a hefty, lanterned wall of heavy wood.

By the time he arrives, it will have started raining heavily.

There should be a settlement a bit after half a day out of Keldmire, making for comfortable evening, and will make him arrive in [[Ralia]] late - the town of [[Carlina]].

### [[Carlina]]
If he arrives even an hour before darkness the front gate will be closed. [[Gatewatcher Tom]] will be behind the side of the wall with a metallic sliding peep hole that he can use to look at anyone outside of the village.
- The front gate is closed and locked, a large keyhole protruding both ways. Lantern light is visible from over the wall but also through the keyhole.
- Peeping hole to the left.
- A large brass bell hangs to the right of the door.


> Excuse the suspicion my lord, but after the sun sets its just not safe to be leaving the gate open to just anyone you don't know. Bandits could send a handsome young gentleman like yourself and catch us with our pants down, and I could lose my life. Let me take your horse for you. You'll likely be wanting the [[Schwarzen Adler Inn]] (the black eagle).


- Evidence of werewolf type shit activity leading up to [[Carlina]]. Someone attacks in the evening, maybe a Manticore from Flee Mortals!. Stirges too.
- The Manticore uses mimicry to attract someone into the night then attack.
- Rain is intense at night, making the entirety of outside lightly obscured. Combined with no light the area becomes heavily obscured

#### Encounter: [[Manticore Statblock|Manticore Mating Pair]] Ambush in the Rain
The manticore will fight in ambush style, using the rain and the light held by those it fights to its advantage.

**Allied Combatants**:
- 3 guards, two with muskets, one holding a torch thats buffeted by the rain only lighting 5ft.
- [[Gatewatcher Tom]]
-  [[Friedrich van Scholer]] uses the noble statblock


- Male manticores use spike throw attacks and females have stingers with much more vicious poisons
- Lair full of bodies in the clock tower

# [[Ralia]]
---
On route East he has to pass through Ralia and there is some kind of powerful evil concealed there. Ralia is plagued by rats and night creatures.

# [[Brocia]]
---
### [[Rudolph van Richten]]
And his Ghost Sycophant [[Erasmus van Richten]] (See the retainer in flee mortals). Son was turned by [[Baron Metus]] a vampire nemesis of [[Rudolph van Richten]]

- Lead them to the [[Underfoot Tollhouse]]
