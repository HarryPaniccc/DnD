## Post Mortem


## Introduction
> Swallow and take what you thought you were meant to be. Reconcile it with who you are. Another lesson learned in time. But oh, you'll find.
> 
> You don't know who you are until you are lost.

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past decades, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- As a child, Rylai Sweetsong danced with the elements and conducted magics with a keen attunement, the likes of which rivalled by few at such a young age.
- One fateful night, however, while trying to push herself beyond her abilities, acting on an impulse of jealousy and a feeling of inferiority, a fatal accident would take everything from the young halfling, leaving her orphaned and burned.
- Rylai would recoil from the flames, unable to face the heat, and froze her heart, and her connection to her magic faded with time. She travelled, hoping to see the world and what the realm had to offer, but she also spent that time running. Hiding.
- Now, inspired by the growth of her friends and found family, the Vanguard, and given the strength to decide for herself, she, aided by the [[Sylph]] [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]], has come to a place of elemental power, lost to time, where she may finally find answers to the questions she has been unable to ask herself.
- It is here, as she plunges into the darkness of the [[Temple of Elemental Evil]], alone, except for the laughing light that is her new friend Ophelia, that Rylai readies herself to face the challenges that the future holds, and the scars that the past has left to fester.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are the first person to step foot along the path you tread in a long, long time.
> 
> The day is the 3rd of *Dul'ussahn*, 813, and you feel almost abuzz with magic, covered head to toe in wards and protection.


# [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]]
Ophelia understands the history of the temple of elements before [[Tharizdun]] fell to the influence of the [[Seed of the Abyss]].

>[!Note] Why did she come with?
>Ophelia can understand the wound that Rylai has inflicted on herself, and she does not want her to continue to suffer. She believes that the only way for her to interact with her connection to the elemental planes is to understand her pain. You can't cut out a tumour if you dont understand it.
>
>Ophelia truly wants Rylai to embrace her connection to the elemental plane of air.

# Five-Room Dungeon | Planning

- **Entrance and Guardian**: The Descent, giant door and gargoyles (vericality)
- **Roleplay or Puzzle**: Recently returned gargoyle and chuul
- **Setback**: Magma elementals guard the
- **Climax**: The [[Ley Nexus]] has come alive
- **Reward**: Enter through the portal to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]

# The Descent | Entrance and Guardian
The first chamber is the stone lined hallway, and a set of stone doors lined with holy seals. The chamber is solemn and feels desperate.

### Flashback
> You are young. Running down a stream that eventually leads into the [[Eithval River]] some distance north of [[Midvale]]. The spring air is still frigid, and you are bundled up against the cold, nose red and slightly too small for your boots.

The waters of the stream are still frozen over from the winter. As a young halfling of maybe twelve years old, your peers already tower over you, so they run ahead of you as you struggle to keep up.

- You have lost them through the woods up ahead. There is a clear path. She has run this route before, but every time she gets left further and further behind.
- The group is running towards a small lake. You are left alone. Your sister isnt even there.
- Over your shoulder, your first instrument is heavy and weighing you down, but you are determined to carry it. **Have Ember describe what the instrument is and how she got it.**
- She must **roll Dexterity 11** to continue running through the slippery terrain using a commoner's statblock (plus zero to the roll).
	- Success = push forwads and cut through the forest using her nible form
	- Fail = slip and fall and ask Ember to react as she would
- Regardless, a young human boy will run back and check on her. Does she accept his help? Or forge on alone?

At the end of the sequence, she is pushing through a tight wall of brush which seqways to the real world

### Descent through Darkness
> Pushing through a miasma of shadow, light from Ophelia barely illuminating your way, the pathway finally smoothes out. Rocky crags morph into ramped cave floor, and eventually again into mostly ruined masonry. After stepping carefully through the darkness of a crevasse that would be tight for someone of greater stature, a chamber is revealed.
> 
> One lined with upright stone figures.

The chamber is vast, some fourty feet square with a pair of giant stone doors at the end, rimmed by a chain-like mechanism. In front of the door are figures.

- The remains bear a resemblance to humans in height. There are maybe 50 of them will be clustered together in the centre of the room. 
- The chains are steel and are guarded against attack


##### Door
The large set of doors in the chamber appear to be warded with prayers.

- **15 Religion** reveals them to be script of [[Lathander]]ian writings, prayers of sealing that warn against entering such a place.
- The wording on the door reads in the Common Tongue: 

>"Here is a place devoid of light. Here is a place devoid of love. Here is a place devoid of honor. Those servants of wrath that would see all undone are forgotten within. The [[Elder Evils]] have failed, and we mark their defeat here, as we do each time we start a new day."

> |Encounter|
> | - |
>|3 x [[Gargoyle]]s appear once the door has opened and fly to attack Rylai. If she is still invisible when the door opens, they will instead be locked in combat with a [[Fire Elemental]]|

##### Balconies
There is a balcony at the top left wall facing inwards, and a second that has collapsed along the right wall. 

- **Investigation 15** on the collapsed balcony's rubble on the ground floor will reveal a chamber beyond. The room barely resembles what it used to. Mossy and fungas, 4 **Giant Fire Beetles** shed light in this room, one on the bones of a **troglodyte**. 
	- **Loot**: Ruined armory. Ancient rusted helmets and shields. Gems set in a rusted gauntlet catch your eye.
- The top left balcony leads to a small square chamber. The exit to the chamber is blocked by a portcullis, beyond which the tunnel has collapsed. Scorch marks are on the walls showing it was intentional.
	- Three eyeballs stare into the center of the room from the walls opposite the entrance. Destroying the eyeballs send screeches through the dungeon. Once all three are destroyed or closed, three runes flash and a lever appears at the center. Pulling the level **opens the door**.
	- Mechanically, the door will re-seal in one minute after it has opened all the way.

> From this point you will be hidden from me small one. Tread carefully, for you enter the **temple of elemental evil**. Long have the spirits within raged against their bonds, and though many slumber now, many shall stir at your entrance.


# Antechamber | Puzzle and RP encounter
The doors open up onto the top of an obsidian monolithic structure overlooking a vast chasm. Darkness stretches outwards, and what few instances of fire and magma and other, stranger sources of light dot the chamber outline a monolithic temple like space. One without the limitations of sanity being considered during its design. Shapes move in the darkness below, and the sound of skittering and flowing ooze echoes periodically through the chamber.

- [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]] will be hurt by how the temple looks. She will explain it was once a place of shared learning and song. But long ago something horrible happened and it became corrupted.
- Darkness beyond her vision.

> I can feel the movements of the stones beneath you, tiny one. My siblings are blind, and slumber, and the wind conceals your movement, but the stones do not lie. You are new here, and of the new world.

A particularly evil earth elemental notices Rylai's presence with his tremorsense, but he will not alert the rest of the temple, as he believes that if he kills her he can use the power of her blood to escape his confinement. Rylai holds the power to open a sealed rift to the elemental planes, and can also step through the veil of the temple's imprisonment.

### Worship Chamber

>[!infobox]
> |Encounter|
> |-|
> |If the spirits are disturbed sufficiently, **2d4 specters will attack Rylai (she rolls)**|

- Dark depiction of an elder evil ([[Tharizdun]]) at the center of the ceiling surrounded by four statues each wounded as one of the elements. Symbols line the grounds outside of them, but the symbols are misaligned
	- Water Earth Fire Air | Fire Air Water Earth
- Two dozen empty cloaks floating, held aloft by the fading spirits of the cultists who adorned them. Disturbing the cloaks slowly angers the spirits. If angered sufficiently, 2d6 Specters will attack Rylai.

### [[Eelax the Gargoyle]]
> A visitor? The elder elemental eye works strangely. Or perhaps a mirage?
> No intent is uniform. I am merely the part of myself that fits within this vessel. The part that slipped away as I fell into slumber.

- Undead gargoyle (missing arm and wing) cloaked in a shroud. 
- **What does he want?**: To stop fighting. To do something other than wander and wait and harm.
- **What does he know?**: Most of the temple slumbers. If a larger or more noticeable force would enter the temple then many of his siblings would awaken.

### Exit to Chamber
By rotating the statues to align with their correct symbols will open a rotating section to the wall that leads onwards. Below is a cistern of still water.
