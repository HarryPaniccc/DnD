**Subsequent Session:**
## Post Mortem

## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light.

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past days, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Attempting to find a way to remove the ties she has to her sorcerous magic, [[Rylai Sweetsong]] has lead the [[Vanguard]] to the [[Synod of Elevation]], an ancient ruin where sorcery was studied by the [[Old Ruinan Empire]].
- Here, the group have battled their way through magical defenses, facing demonic and elemental powers, as well as a group of mad flameskulls, who used to be servants who operated in the Synod. One of the flameskulls, [[Maurice the Flameskull]], seems to have acknowledged the group as minsters of the Synod, and has been aiding them in navigating the ruin.
- With Maurice's guide, the party made their way towards the study of the headminister of the Synod, [[Marthirion]], and did battle with the reconstituted flameskull servants, as well as a collection of Helmed Horrors, wielding elementally enhanced swords.
- Once the defences had been dealt with, the group freed an elemental spirit that was trapped in the blade of one of the constructs, who identified herself as [[Ophelia the Sylph|Ophelia]]. As the group saw to their wounds and prepared to enter into the main office, where they may find the information Rylai seeks, the elemental seemed to see something within Rylai, questioning her about her true goals, but not revealing much more.
- Our heroes made their way into the large stone chamber and found it in a state of esoteric chaos, the very knowledge from the surrounding books stretching through space and being absorbed by a terrible page on the central dias. After Dusk cast a translation spell on the page, and once the knowledge of a single word took root in her mind, the corpse of Marthirion jerked awake, and let out a fell screech.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are warped, the fabric of the contents of shelves stretched and almost flowing like liquid towards the centre of the room. One thing is for certain though, you are no longer alone.
> 
> The day is the 29th of *Antumbrahn*, 813, and the shadows recoil around you as a surge of arcane energy pulses from the form of [[Marthirion|Marthirion, Marred by Seeing]], as he is raised into the air of the chamber.

# Marthirion, Marred by Seeing
---
> *The door opens into a vast stone chamber, more well decorated than any of the others, and seemingly untouched by the damage caused by the denizens of the dungeon. Two raised balconies, one on either side hold bookshelves whose contents look like they may dissolve at a touch. A pair of small, decorative columns sit within the room, their middle sections seemingly shattered and held in place by some unseen magical effect, creating a discontinuity in the structure.
> 
> The contents of the bookshelves appear to be stretched and smeared across the surfaces of the chamber, like putty or paint of a known shape dragged by the hand of a careless child, ruining a clear portrait. In places, the smearing seems to float along river-like shapes, all leading to the center of the room, where, slumped over a reading lecturn amidst a desk covered in a thin, black mass, lies a corpse wearing the tattered remains of a mage's robe.*

Within the head chamber of the Synod there exists a central lecturn, on which is the corpse of Headminister [[Marthirion]], and a single page of the [[Book of Vile Darkness]] containing the name [[Dagon]].

>[!If Rylai Goes Down]
>At last you feel the coldness envelope you comepletely. No more motion, no more pain from memory or truth, no more fear of consequence or the future. Just an icy, eternal, still winter that has fallen on your frozen heart. Peace at last. Nothingness. 
>
>And for a moment, you want it. Until across the frigid landscape of the you that can no longer feel... a gentle wind blows. Not a gale. Not a storm. But a breath. Motion of more than just the body. Life. Freedom. 
>
>The wind carries your name. But it also carries pain. Memory and truth. Love. The wind has been with you for your entire journey. Around you and within you.
>
>And now it pushes you onwards, towards truth.
