## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- With the evil of the [[Vorciln]] defeated, [[Kanan Einzbern]] now is left with the burden of the [[Vessel of Avarice]]. 
- Inside it is trapped [[Athelstan]], the source of the curse of his family that has persisted for thousands of years.
- Now, determined to create a permanent solution to the dangers that he has been intrusted with by the Vanguard, and with the objectives of improving his gear, Kanan plans to take one of the hardest pilgrimages known to his people; he plans to journey to the distant dwarven kingdom of [[Steinwalde]], hidden for millennia, deep in the ranges of the [[Maghlas Mountains]].

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are well tended and comfortable. Servants eagerly help your preparations, loading up your horse for the long journey ahead. One thing is for certain though, the air grows colder as the winter sets in.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are excited for the journey ahead.

# Departure from Keldmire
---
### Ask for Rictavio
Awaiting at the entrance to the lane leading to [[Luthrand Manor]], cloaked in his cloak and hat stands the familiar, bone thin figure of [[Jarren Ward]]. He will tell Kanan to use Until Dawn on his journey to get used to the way the weapon feels, and to go to a bar named the [[Underfoot Tollhouse]] in [[Brocia]] when he gets there.

### The Journey Begins
> Heading East the well-worn but well maintained road sweeps dramatically ahead of you, cutting first through farmland, and then later over low-lying hills and scattered forests. After an hour or so of riding you have already left behind the [[Keldmire]] orchards and farm houses. Lanterns become rarer to see along the side of the roads, and once or twice you pass by ruined keeps and castles, one even seems to be reduced to just a pile of stone and a few walls.
> 
> After hours of riding, you come round a bend, the path ahead of you obscured by light woodland, and begin riding alongside a hefty, lanterned wall of heavy wood.

By the time he arrives, it will have started raining heavily.

There should be a settlement a bit after half a day out of Keldmire, making for comfortable evening, and will make him arrive in [[Ralia]] late - the town of [[Carlina]].

# [[Carlina]]
---
If he arrives even an hour before darkness the front gate will be closed. [[Gatewatcher Tom]] will be behind the side of the wall with a metallic sliding peep hole that he can use to look at anyone outside of the village.
- The front gate is closed and locked, a large keyhole protruding both ways. Lantern light is visible from over the wall but also through the keyhole.
- Peeping hole to the left.
- A large brass bell hangs to the right of the door.


> Excuse the suspicion my lord, but after the sun sets its just not safe to be leaving the gate open to just anyone you don't know. Bandits could send a handsome young gentleman like yourself and catch us with our pants down, and I could lose my life. Let me take your horse for you. You'll likely be wanting the [[Schwarzen Adler Inn]] (the black eagle).

Many Rats run around the roads of the village.

### The [[Schwarzen Adler Inn]]

#### NPCs
- Two gentlemen with wide-brimmed hats sit in a corner, one with a musket, the other with a wide-headed great axe. They will stick to their own conversation.
- [[Friedrich van Scholer]] is a nobly dressed and very pompous human of THICK Sirkonian accent. He doesnt do any carrying or cooking but certainly runs the books well, and tends to every person who comes in. He knows regulars by name.
- [[Sheriff Magus Cudgel]] is a wiry, intelligent and well focussed sheriff. Like Silco but Sirkonian.

### Encounter: [[Manticore Statblock|Manticore Mating Pair]] Ambush in the Rain

> Through the noise of the room and the song, a sharp crack is heard outside. That wasn't thunder, someone just fired a musket. A moment later, the scream of a man dying and choking on his blood is heard. Outside a torchlight can be seen running towards the square outside of the inn.

The manticore will fight in ambush style, using the rain and the light held by those it fights to its advantage.
- The Manticore uses mimicry to attract someone into the night then attack.
- Rain is intense at night, making the entirety of outside lightly obscured. Combined with no light the area becomes heavily obscured even with some light
- The female manticore will not expose itself as much, the male looking to put down the guards and spike Kanan a bit, but will dive out of the darkness.
- **When one Manticore is slain, the other will flee back to its lair and gain a legendary action**

**Allied Combatants**:
- 5 guards, two with muskets, one holding a torch thats buffeted by the rain only lighting 5ft. They use the Human Guard Minion statblock from FM but the musket wielders group attack deals 3 damage each.
- [[Gatewatcher Tom]]
-  [[Friedrich van Scholer]] uses the noble statblock

![[Pasted image 20250126145408.png]]

- Male manticores use spike throw attacks and females have stingers with much more vicious poisons

### Encounter: [[Manticore Statblock|Manticore]] Lair in the [[Abandoned Clock Tower]]
The manticores makes their lair in the [[Abandoned Clock Tower]] of [[Carlina]]. In its lair, the manticore gains the following legendary action:
>[!Legendary Action]
>#### Infuriated Roar
>The manticore's strength increases by 3 and when it moves a creature they move an additional 10 feet and if they strike a surface they suffer an additional 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
>#### The following trigger on attacking a prone target
>While infuriated, a missed sting attack lodges the manticore's tail in the ground until the end of its next turn, during this time it cant use the stinger. 
>
>If it misses a bite its target becomes grappled by the manticore, however the target loses access to their hands as it is forced on keeping the head at bay. The target can choose to end this grapple and free their hands, but allow the manticore to make another bite as a reaction that doesnt trigger this ability.


# [[Ralia]]

On route East he has to pass through Ralia and there is some kind of powerful evil concealed there. Ralia is plagued by rats and night creatures.

# [[Brocia]]

### [[Rudolph van Richten]]
And his Ghost Sycophant [[Erasmus van Richten]] (See the retainer in flee mortals). Son was turned by [[Baron Metus]] a vampire nemesis of [[Rudolph van Richten]]

- Lead them to the [[Underfoot Tollhouse]]
