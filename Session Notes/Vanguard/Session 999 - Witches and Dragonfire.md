**Previous Session:** [[Session 85 - Estravian Brigands]]
**Subsequent Session:**
## Introduction
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Our heroes are on a journey to [[Steinwalde]], the hidden dwarven fortress north of [[Sirkonos]]
- Kanan and Caede, accompanied by the protector kronesguard of [[Valeria]], have begun making their way towards the [[Faults of North Estravia]],
- While setting up for lunch the next morning, the group investigated the stench of death, and defeated a group of ghouls that were enjoying a meal, as well as an invisible air spirit of some kind.
- After this battle, having burned the remains, the group came to realize that their travelling party had been surrounded by bandits, led by the same man who they had freed the werewolf from
- After defeating the bandits, and reconciling with [[Syr Edmund]]'s niece, they made their way to [[Trau's End]], the small village at the end of the valley.
### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).
