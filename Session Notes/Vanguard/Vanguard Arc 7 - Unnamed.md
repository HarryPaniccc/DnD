There are a lot of things that need to be cleared up before I can specify exactly what is happening. [[King Sirkon]] is returning to power now that his new physical form, [[Prince Artorius Sirkon]] has matured and begun to show promise. He needs the [[Heart of the Abyss]] to complete his Son's rise to power so that he might control his son as an avatar of himself.

# Planning Reset

>[!Simple Questions]
>1. **BBEG**: [[King Sirkon|Sirkon]]. Desires rule of [[Eranulaid]] and command of the [[Abyss]] through the [[Heart of the Abyss]], but his physical form requires [[Prince Artorius Sirkon]] to be his physical avatar.
>2. **High Tower Surprise**: The Betrayal. The game was rigged from the start. 
>3. **Lieutenants**: [[Syr Bayle Renslayer|Bayle]]. Bayle is the most loyal of the lieutenants, acting as the primary organizer of the armies under his command. It is Bayle's work that causes the war in [[Desseran]].
>   [[Zakuul]]. Manipulated yet unpredictable, Zakuul is an agent for Sirkon, but not extremely loyal. His vengeance is an easy route to the weakening of Ruina, as well as allowing Sirkon to get to whatever is in the [[City of the Glass Moon]].
>   [[Ulrandir Vanariel]]. He wants vengeance on the [[Uldronos Council]], and something to do with [[Smudge]].

# Outline
---
The consequences of unclosed storylines coalesce as [[Eranulaid]] goes up in flames. War is brewing in every corner. The dark corners of the world are responding to the coming of a messiah that has long been foretold.

- Sirkon needs what's in the city of the glass moon
- [[King Sirkon|Sirkon]] has used his powers to grant gifts to those that he seeks loyalty from. They understand his power, and accept the positive relationship but know to turn against his will is death

### Antagonists
[[King Sirkon|Sirkon]] is behind it all obviously. His objective is to reclaim the [[Heart of the Abyss]] so that [[Prince Artorius Sirkon]] can ascend and act as his material vassal of the abyss and bring around his rule of [[Eranulaid]].

His commanders/generals/lieutenants include: [[Syr Bayle Renslayer]] [[Ulrandir Vanariel]], [[Zakuul]], [[Darius Nubide]]'s simulacrum, [[Sirkons Goristro Lieutenant]], [[Sirkons Marileth Lieutenant]].

### Desired Plot Points + Brainstorming

- The Red Wizard woman who has the vampire spawn has some kind of goal
- The [[Nightshade Peaks]] and a fortress there go to war with [[Desseran]] and [[Sirkonos]], [[Sion of Orcus]] in rulership
- [[General Isaac]] goes mad after assassinations take his wife and child
- [[Alfred Gundrei]] is elected king of [[Ruina]]
- Caede dreams of the strength of [[Orcus]] growing in the [[Nightshade Peaks]]
- Fight with an [[Eldar]] in the underdark with a crazy powerful ring or something. Proper Syndra from LOL sorceress type shit


>[!Important]
>- Escalation needs to occur throughout each section.
>- This is the [[Vanguard|Vanguard's]] story, no one character's
## Prologue
Want to do an adventure where people find a clue to Sirkon and then die, starting the attacks on Desseran.

## Act 1 - [[City of the Glass Moon]]
When [[Zakuul]] defeated [[Darius Nubide]] he decided that not only are the Drow his enemy, but so is [[Ruina]] - it was a Ruinan group that sold him into slavery, and now a member of the [[Uldronos Council]] has come to try enslave him. He would torture Darius for a long time which drew [[King Sirkon|Sirkon's]] attention. Sirkon would parlay with and intimidate Zakuul, granting him a simulacrum of Darius to use in his dismantling of his opponents.

Sirkon's desire with this move is to weaken Ruina and reclaim something that is within the [[City of the Glass Moon]]. Zakuul will use what he has been granted by Sirkon to initiate a war against the Drow while also tactically involving Ruina.

[[Ulrandir Vanariel]], soon to be executed, has already been saved by Sirkon - a simulacrum placed in his stead. Ulrandir has been promised rule over Ruina once the dust settles, and has been made to assist Zakuul.

This causes a terrible alliance to be forged with the goal of the destruction of Ruina and her armies. Ulrandir and his honor guard, [[Orcs|Orc]] abyssal loyalists to Sirkon, and the [[Duergar]] servants of Zakuul assemble in the ruins of an old ruinan stronghold. Their first victim? [[Vasspryg]] will fall.
### Events summary
##### Background

- [[Alfred Gundrei]] becomes Duke of [[Ruina]].
- [[Darius Nubide]] acts as a mole and proxy in the Ruinan government. This treachery will allow [[Vasspryg]] to fall.
- 

- [[Alfred Gundrei]] has become Duke and immediately had to take war council
- [[Darius Nubide]] acts as [[Zakuul|Zakuul's]] proxy within the [[Ruina]] government so that Zakuul can cause another front of destruction for the drow 
- [[King Sirkon]] wants something from within the [[City of the Glass Moon]], and has given [[Zakuul]] the tools to achieve control of an [[Orcs]] (?) army to aid in has assaults - **Demon/Zodd guys are Sirkon's control of the situation**
- [[General Isaac]] is in command of many of the [[Boreal Conclave]] forces but has focused on defending himself from assassins trying to kill him (Sent by Zakuul?/Ulrandir?/Darius?). They are getting past his security using the **Paintings**

##### Key Points

- War breaks out in Ruina on two fronts. [[Orcs|Orc]] demon loyalists strike, as do [[Drow]] raider refugees.
- [[Vasspryg]] falls, [[Midvale]] becomes a defensive position for the [[Boreal Conclave]] and [[Ashen Legion]].
- [[General Isaac]] won't push forwards as he believes there is treachery in the ranks.

- General Isaac nearly sells his home to [[Zariel]] for protection. Zariel has interest in this as an agent against [[Demons|Demonic]] forces
- The painting leads them to a layer of the [[Abyss]] where a number of other paintings are used. Smudge's people are imprisoned there?

- Travel the [[Underdark]] and come to the [[City of the Glass Moon]] and battle with the [[Eldar]] there, the high priestess of something or other.


### [[General Isaac]] Assassin Plot and Painting Revelation

### Arcane Sickness Plot and [[Zakuul]] Reveal

### Proxy War

## Act 2 - War in [[Desseran]] and the [[Nightshade Peaks]]
News from [[Desseran]] reaches Ruina: evil from the [[Nightshade Peaks]] has begun pouring against the city's defenders in the regions to the west of the river. King Sirkon will have fallen ill, ceding the throne to [[Prince Artorius Sirkon|Arthur Sirkon]]. Arthur will task Kanan with the mission of meeting with the leaders of Desseran, as Sirkonos and Desseran united may be able to harry the nightshade peaks from both sides more effectively.

The [[Thayan Orthodoxy]] woman has the wit to ask: why now? And why in this manner? Why is the [[Sion of Orcus]] waging war on Desseran, and more importantly, why did he start by attacking a rinky dinky little town in the middle of nowhere? She thinks someone found some artifact that he needed to stay hidden.

- [[Silver Talon]] fortress
- [[Caede]] given the task of destroying the [[Sion of Orcus]]
- "You have heard the beating too."
