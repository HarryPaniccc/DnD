There are a lot of things that need to be cleared up before I can specify exactly what is happening. [[King Sirkon]] is returning to power now that his new physical form, [[Prince Artorius Sirkon]] has matured and begun to show promise. He needs the [[Heart of the Abyss]] to complete his Son's rise to power so that he might control his son as an avatar of himself.



# Outline
---
The consequences of unclosed storylines coalesce as [[Eranulaid]] goes up in flames. War is brewing in every corner. The dark corners of the world are responding to the coming of a messiah that has long been foretold.

- Sirkon needs what's in the city of the glass moon
- 

### Desired Plot Points Brainstorming

- The Red Wizard woman who has the vampire spawn has some kind of goal
- The [[Nightshade Peaks]] and a fortress there go to war with [[Desseran]] and [[Sirkonos]], [[Sion of Orcus]] in rulership
- [[General Isaac]] goes mad after assassinations take his wife and child
- [[Alfred Gundrei]] is elected king of [[Ruina]]
- Caede dreams of the strength of [[Orcus]] growing in the [[Nightshade Peaks]]
- Fight with an [[Eldar]] in the underdark with a crazy powerful ring or something. Proper Syndra from LOL sorceress type shit


>[!Important]
>- Escalation needs to occur throughout each section.
>- This is the [[Vanguard|Vanguard's]] story, no one character's
## Prologue
Want to do an adventure where people find a clue to Sirkon and then die, starting the attacks on Desseran.

## Act 1 - [[City of the Glass Moon]]
The [[Duergar]] under the control of [[Zakuul]] are waging war with the [[Drow]] who imprisoned Zakuul, attacking the [[City of the Glass Moon]] and driving refugees and raiders to the surface. These raiders are raiding [[Ruina]]'s cities around the [[Dularen Plains]].
### Events summary
- [[Alfred Gundrei]] has become king and immediately had to take war council
- [[Darius Nubide]] acts as [[Zakuul|Zakuul's]] proxy within the [[Ruina]] government (==Why==)
- [[King Sirkon]] wants something from within the [[City of the Glass Moon]], and has given [[Zakuul]] the tools to achieve control of an [[Orcs]] (?) army to aid in has assaults - **Demon/Zodd guys are Sirkon's control of the situation**
- [[General Isaac]] is in command of many of the [[Boreal Conclave]] forces but has focused on defending himself from assassins trying to kill him (Sent by Zakuul?/Ulrandir?/Darius?). They are getting past his security using the **Paintings**

#### As I see it

- War breaks out in Ruina against [[Drow]] and [[Orcs]]. Gundrei loses control of General Isaac due to assassinations.
- General Isaac nearly sells his home to [[Zariel]] for protection. Zariel has interest in this as an agent against [[Demons|Demonic]] forces
- The painting leads them to a layer of the [[Abyss]]
- All the while [[Darius Nubide]] has acted incredibly antithesis to the Drow
- 
- 
- Travel the [[Underdark]] and come to the [[City of the Glass Moon]] and battle with the [[Eldar]] there, the high priestess of something or other.
