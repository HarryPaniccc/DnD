# Things to Remember

Kanan spends minimum time in Brocia (like one day of prep)

### Gold at the start of downtime
I'm not going to track each gold piece but its a good idea to get an idea of funds right now.

# Random ideas that don't fit anywhere

- Vin-like rogue girl
- People coming to the vanguard
- Connections and **friends and allies** - [[Viscount Gale Luthrand]] for example and Tevis' connections
- Use the retainers thing
- **SWIM FROM MIDVALE PLEDGES ALLEGIANCE TO THE VANGUARD WITH LIZARDFOLK**
- Tournament hosted by the Vanguard to find those willing to fight for them

# Units per Character
---
The PC's are going to be accumulating allies throughout this period.
### Communal
- Whatever is added to [[Trayfort Keep]]
- They should get a sage?
### Caede
- [[Count Drakus]] acts as an **Ambassador** for Caede
- 
### Kanan
- **Thayan Scribe** as a steward
- **Changeling Spy** for his work in the [[Sirkonos|Sirkonian]] courts
### Rylai
- Maybe a tailor? idfk

# [[Kanan Einzbern|Kanan]]
---
[[Kanan Einzbern|Kanan]] is going to spend his time in [[Sirkonos|Sirkonos]]. His focus is going to be on helping the people who were abandoned when the [[Vorciln]] attacked, travel and sort his equipment, as well as fulfil his role as the [[Hand of Sirkonos]].

### Pilgrimage to [[Steinwalde]]

- [[Session 84 - Travel to Steinwalde]]
- [[Session 83 - Through the Sirkonian Countryside (Start of Arc)]]

Kanan plans to travel north of [[Sirkonos|Sirkonos]] in order to find aid from the dwarves of [[Steinwalde]] in reforging [[Anathema]] and in turning the [[Vessel of Avarice]] into [[Nightfall, The Twilight Blade]]. Kanan is going to need the help of a guide of some kind, in addition to carefully managing his resources for the long trip. [[Rudolph van Richten]] is his guide

- Overload the chalice and maybe go to the hells?
#### Gear Ideas
One of the primary objectives too is for Kanan to sort out some of his gear on this journey. Gear should be put into the [[Magic Item Pricing + Crafting]] document too.

- [[+2 Green Dragon Scale Leather Armor]]
- [[Infernal Compass]]
- [[Potion of Vampiric Sense]]
- [[Repeating Crossbow]]
- 

### Count Einzbern
Kanan will also need to be introduced to the courts of the [[Nobility of Sirkonos]] in preparation for his role as [[Prince Artorius Sirkon|Arthur's]] [[Hand of Sirkonos]]. Kanan will be offered a **steward** and a **spy**.

- Spy [[Doppelganger|Doppelganger]]
- [[Thayan Orthodoxy]] Steward

In addition, [[Tevis Einzbern]] desires to rebuild the Einzbern house and Kanan will need to help him find allies. See [[House Luthrand]]. 

He will be asked to kill [[Lord Malgus Kraber]].

### Witcher Work
Something certainly happens in [[Ralia]].

### Commander of the [[Battalion of the Silver Arrow|Silver Arrow]]
[[Gnolls]] are growing in commonality in the wastes and the foothills surrounding the [[Nightshade Peaks]]. Also maybe send him to stifle some kind of dissent against the Sirkonian line Game of Thrones style.

# [[Caede]]
---
### Defences and Staff of [[Trayfort Keep]]
The Vanguard have been gone from their home for some time, and during that time Trayfort has been defended by a group of ashen legion. It is a mess, having been ransacked by [[Meeek]] the kobold, as well as other vermin.

### Herald of the [[Deathwatch]]
### Dungeon Delving
Caede intends to supply arms for the guards of [[Trayfort Keep]] by looting [[Vorciln Castle]]


# [[Rylai Sweetsong|Rylai]]
---
- [ ] Perform magic ritual thing
- [ ] Speak with [[Darius Nubide]] - **arcane sickness plot**
- [ ] Find [[Lina Sweetsong]]
- [ ] Places for her to perform - [[Uldronos Council]] member parties and such
	- [ ] Mercantile Guilds parties
	- [ ] Baron's parties
- [ ] Information from noble parties

### [[Ley Lines]] and the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]

- [[Session 86 - The Synod of Elevation]]
- [[Session 87 - An Element of Truth]]

Rylai desires some kind of way to expel her sorcerous magic, rejecting who she was trying to be and becoming who she really is. Swallow and take what you thought you were meant to be. Reconcile it with who you are. Type shit.

Rylai shied away from the truth that she believes is likely - that she killed her parents - and, for fear of being harmed by it, has shut herself off and become cold, stifling her sorcerous powers. She must accept the truth and realize that [[Lina Sweetsong]] started the fire, a truth that does not hurt as much as the lie she has been telling herself.

- Her research will lead her to understanding Magic and the connection of [[Ley Lines]] and the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]
- [[Sylphmade Scarf]] (flying scarf thing like Serpico's cloak)
- [[Akadi]] the [[Primordials|Primordial]] of air



### [[Darius Nubide]]
> Rylai rolled a 12 on her random encounter table which means its time for the dishevelled interaction.
> 
> *The evening air is comfortable surrounding Trayfort. The wooden flooring and small fireplaces in each of the important rooms make the keep's temperature easy to maintain. Ulfric always lights what is needed as it is needed. 
> 
> One evening, before going to bed you finish off the end of a previously started collection of ballads before sating your appetite for entertainment for the evening, so you make your way from your desk to the nearly desolate library to replace the book and find a new one.
> 
> After returning to your room and placing the tome of choice on your bed side table you go and close your door for the evening. You watch as your shadow is outlined on the door by a beautiful blue flash from behind you, and turn to see a man holding a staff standing in your room.
> 
> You know Darius Nubide to be a completely composed man, in control of every aspect of himself, and most aspects of the environments he inhabits. The man before you has longer, unkept hair. His beard is untrimmed. He doesn't look like he has slept in the last 24 hours, and he leans on a staff forged of beautiful rune-inscribed spell metal, betraying his age for the first time since you have known him. He tries to conceal an increasingly bloodied bandage on his left hand.
> 
> "It is improper for one such as yourself to summon a member of the Uldronos Council, especially to command something of me." He does not shout, but his anger, exhaustion, and frustration is evident in his tone.*
