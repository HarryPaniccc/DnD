## Introduction

> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Kanan Einzbern]], having set out on the beginnings of his journey through the [[Sirkonos]] countryside, stopping at the village of [[Carlina]] and hunting and defeating a mating pair of [[Manticore]]s has found his way to [[Brocia]] to meet an ally
- Since then, his preparations in the city have concluded and he begins his journey north to [[Strahldale]] alongside a new ally, the legendary [[Rudolph van Richten]].
- Travel through the countryside has gone well the first few days, you have found lodgings at small roadside inns or with holdfasts manned by local lords' men.

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, the meal before you would sate any man in this age, or the last.
> 
> The day is the 12th of Antumbrahn, 813, and you are warm and comfortable, as the fatty meat of an autumn-slaughtered swine fills your belly for your evening meal.

Something happens

# The [[Sieleran River]] Trail

Follow the river for some time before heading west and curling up the foothills.

Something else happens

Thunder in the night, like the mountain was going to come down on you - it was really a dragon taking out a regiment or raiding a bridge
