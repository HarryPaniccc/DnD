## Introduction

> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Kanan Einzbern]], having set out on the beginnings of his journey through the [[Sirkonos]] countryside, stopping at the village of [[Carlina]] and protecting them from a monster hidden within their midst has found his way to [[Brocia]] to meet an ally
- Since then, his preparations in the city have concluded and he begins his journey north to [[Strahldale]] alongside a new ally, the legendary vampire hunter [[Rudolph van Richten]].
- Travel through the countryside has gone well the first few days, you have found lodgings at small roadside inns or with holdfasts manned by local lords' men.

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are warm, and well lit by candlelight hearth. Conversation and music float through the evening air. One thing is for certain, the meal before you would sate any man in this age, or the last.
>
> The day is the 12th of Antumbrahn, 813, and you are warm and comfortable, as the fatty meat of an autumn-slaughtered swine fills your belly for your evening meal.


# Session Start

Encounter holdfasts in the countryside, as well as encountering the lord who grows mad. [[Kanan Einzbern|Kanan]] and [[Caede]] will reunite in [[Strahldale]] and travel the road north along the [[Sieleran River]] until they enter province of [[Estravia]].

### Kanan's Blurb (out of game)
> Your journey from Brocia begins early one morning. A gentle dew covers the well-worn streets of the city, and even in the pre-dawn light the townspeople are well into their busied schedules, and you know if you were to leave much later it would be difficult to manoeuvre your and Van Richten's horses while so well packed without risking losing something to a pickpocket in town, especially someone with so nice a coat as you.
>
> The first few days north of Brocia see the main road curve west away from the borders of the wastes, leaving a good day's worth of travel between any settlements and the beginnings of the scar that stretches across the kingdom. The countryside is littered with small villages and towns, often a few hours apart from one another just off of the main road, and every few miles stands a watchtower, or greater holdfast controlled by a local lord or sheriff. The roads are wilder and clearly less safe than central Sirkonos, but during the journey you are never left wanting for a comfortable inn in your first two nights, so long as the two of you dont stray from the more worn roads for as long as they last.

### Caede's Checklist
- Longbow carving takes 5 days and 25 gp (with [[Skoldr Wittlewood]])
- Fishing rod is done easily with your experience after the longbow, and you manage to work some basic fishing tackle stuff too but supplement it a bit with what you need to buy. Its costs and the tackle together make for 5sp
- Hunting the pelts and things for the thick tents takes some time, please role a survival check for me, or you can go hunting with a ranger for a small cost to make tracking much easier (nat 1 on the check. Didnt go so well, but can be bought)
- Canvas covers are like 2cp no big deal there like even getting Ulfric to pick some up when he goes shopping he gets them for you
- Two Yaks (https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#ox_mpmm) at 15gp each
### Carry Animals
- Kanan's riding horse
- Van Richten's draft horse
- The two Yaks
- Caedes summons

# Mad Lord's Hold
---
Kanan and Rudolph have made it to a sheltered wooded region amidst some hills and rocks, a few miles west of where the [[Eastern Wastes]] begin. They have ended their travels for the evening at the [[Drachenzunge Inn]]. The inn is full, at each table a different group of freeriders or mercenaries or even some [[Kronesguard]] bearing colours of an unknown battalion.

### Rumours of [[Rokbaur Castle]]
During the night a conversation can be heard coming from the table of a group of sell swords as they argue about their next plan. [[Lord Malgus Kraber]]
- Work is going well around [[Rokbaur Castle]]
- Two won't go back there
- No clean water, everything is grey and black and nothing is green
- You heard what happened to the lord of the holdfast? Everyone knows his mad son killed him. Pushed him into fire. No I heard he ate his heart. I heard the father sick and needed to be put out of his misery.
- They say his sons, one highborn and a bastard, are vicious and cruel. But that is what you would want out of a warden of the wastes.
### Detour
The morning comes and the intense rain in the night persists. Just half an hour of riding brings the pair to a road that would cut through a small dip in the hill lands, but instead simply ends in a river of strong currents. The rain doesn't seem to let up.

There is a detour which will take them around, but will lead through the village close to the wastes, and the pair will find no comfort there. That, or they risk losing the horses attempting to cross the channel.

The lord and his sons are out with their battalion in the wastes, guarding his lands.

### Encounter: Gnoll Ambush
- Gnoll Abyssal Summoner (21)
- Gnoll Bonesplitter (14)
- Gnoll Marauders (Uplifted) (after summoner)

If things go hard, the [[Battalion of the Black Dogs]] will ride in and surround the group, led by [[Lord Malgus Kraber]] wielding his lance.


# [[Strahldale]]
---
> The remaining journey is not long. Three days of riding along the main road north, often passing or joining travelling groups heading to the great fortress of [[Steinjotunenwand]], until eventually you too pass through its magnificent gates, its impossibly large cannon ever vigilantly aimed north, a relic of a war long since won. The forest around you 

### [[Castle Vorciln]] Revisited
Caede wants to loot the dungeons for armour and weapons

# The [[Sieleran River]] Trail
---
Follow the river for some time before heading west and curling up the foothills.
Maybe encounter the [[Steinefni Mining Company]]?

# [[Estravia]]
---
Something else happens


### Collapsed Bridge
Thunder in the night, like the mountain was going to come down on you - it was really a dragon taking out a regiment or raiding a bridge
