**WHEN LAST WE LEFT OFF**

### Erin Einzbern and Kanan
- Open with initiative
- During combat Erin cannot die truly, his form can be knocked down, forcing him to use an action to reconstitute.

When Erin's form is destroyed, his spirit will be thrust out of his body until the end of the person who knocked him down. He will reconstitute his form on his turn. If the spirit is sundered, he immediately reconstitutes.

**Sundering the spirit**
- Jarren Ward's ghost will join in the fray. In the first round he will rush Erin and Pull his form out. Erin's spirit will be partially separated from his skeleton avatar.
- The spirit has 100 HP. Dropping to zero hit points will sunder it, allowing Jarren to attempt to wrest control of his cadaver from it
- Erin's body is at half HP right now
##### Spirit of Jarren Ward: Jarren grants Kanan proficiency with firearms

**Erin quotes**
*"What we had was real. I do consider you my friends and this hurts me a lot. But when I came back, I had only one thing in my mind, and that was purpose. This is that purpose"*

*"I do not want it to end this way. Let me leave with the chalice, and you can have your victory. The Vorciln are no more today. We have won.*
### The Einzbern Curse

### Arthur
*"Two years ago, a great shadow was cast over our homeland. Sirkonos was wounded and its people bled. The very crown you put your faith into to protect you was seduced and forced into the hands of evil, and some of our greatest protectors were hunted down for false crimes. But today light returns to our country. Today the the darkness is dispelled. Today the Einzberns have returned, and today I make you all a promise - an oath. To forge forwards with sword in hand, and to become a prince that this country can rely on. Together we will continue to protect this kingdom, and avenge and make proud all those who have fallen!"*

- Arthur trusts neither Tevis or Jarren truly after the betrayal. He only truly trusts Kanan the most due to his lineage, his commitment to the Sirkonians, and his unwavering determination and focus.
