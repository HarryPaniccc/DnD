**## Session 65 - The Sieleran River Trail

WHEN LAST WE LEFT OFF

- Drakus had identified that the markings on the tapestry indicated that the temple is buried somewhere north, in a crystalline cave network near a town known as Strahldale

  

STRAHLDALE

Outside the northmost border of Sirkonos, squeezed between an ancient northern forest, the eastern wastes, and the Maghlas mountains, sitting comfortably on a gentle section of the foothills, is the quiet farming village of Strahldale. One of the calmest places in Sirkonos, Strahldale’s grazing fields rarely see a year without bountiful grazing. As such, and due to crop fields being too difficult to maintain on the slopes, Strahldale has become a very potent agricultural powerhouse. Although the chill in the winters descending from the mountains means that large barns need to be constructed to keep the animals warm and safe, Strahldale sees many furs, skins, meats and other animal products being exported throughout the harvest seasons.

  

The mineral water from the Efthalian Cave flows down the Sieleran River through the foothills north of the village, and collects in the White Lake south of the village. To the east, one can see the wastes, and to the west, a large, dark stretch of wilderness known as the Miletohr Wilds.

### Notable Locations

- Shöppe. Owned by Strudel and his with Merideth.
    
- Trading Market. A myriad of trades goods are sold around town, but they are mostly what 
    
- Central Rivers. Running through the village, entering from the top of the wall and splitting into multiple smaller streams, a beautiful, pure mineral water river runs through the town, originating from the 
    
- Smithy. Lunds smithy a weapons/armour shop. Lund had been well trained in her home city, but doesn't often get a chance to work with heavy materials to forge what she was taught to, so any opportunity she is glad to make something big. For a price.
    

### Notable Characters

- Shöppekeep Strudel. Elderly, not all there gnomish man. Manic in speech and not consistent speech patterns
    
- Blacksmith Lund. A young, slightly bearded female dwarf with her eyebrows incinerated off. Gentle in tone but strict on her business. Lund was born in Steinwald and made her way south to get away from her family. Lund knows about the Steinefni mining outpost that can be found at the source of the river, as the dwarves that pass through Strahldale for supplies have confided in her over time, or she pieced it together.
    
- Sheriff Thron. A rounder and heavier man than most, Thron is cold and focussed on his work, but kind to the children of Strahldale. He is bald and low eyed, and deep of voice. Thron is experienced in combat; in his youth he was part of an adventuring party who used to hunt lycans and other beasts of the sirkonian wastes for bounties.
    

  

A DREAM OF GHOSTS

One night while Kanan sleeps, the ghost of Jarr

FOLLOWING THE SIELERAN RIVER

Information on the Ethfalian Caverns in the village is not well permeated. Heading into the wilderness to the north is a surefire way of being abducted or eaten by the surrounding lands’ monsters. 

- Lund has information on the Steinefni Company Mining outpost at the entrance to the Ethfalian Caverns
    
- It is known that the mineral water has some kind of magical property. Some of the townspeople would call it a “Gift from the elves” from before the age.
    

The

SITE OF BEHIR BATTLE

After about a half-day’s worth of searching through the wilderness that shrouds these foothills, the smell of freshly burned wood and flesh permeates through the air. 

Searching the ground and area around you, you see what appears to be a large indentation in the dirt foliage leading up to a boulder that has shifted in its base, like something has been dragged and slammed into this large rock. Whatever did this is of considerable size. The boulder itself appears blackened by some kind of intense flame or other means and bears that same burned smell. The trail ahead is marked by a large amount of blood.

Up ahead, over a small foliage wall of roots and rocks there appears to be a natural pillar made of stone and dirt and roots, atop which once would have stood a tree, but the tree now lies knocked over, forming a sort of natural bridge between a boulder cluster and the pillar. Over the felled tree there appears to be a massive reptilian creature. The corpse of a recently deceased behir.

- Behir: The creature is akin in shape to a massive snake, but along its torso there are what can be counted to be 6 pairs of legs. The plates along its body are akin to that of dragonhide or crocodile skin, and the head is draconic or reptilian in nature with these huge curling horns that stretch back for around a meter each. 
    

- The body appears to have had chunks of flesh torn from the side of the upper chest, exposing its ribcage, which appears to have been hollowed out by some sort of large predator.
    
- The ribs and bones appear to be made of some kind of crystal like material.
    
- The stomach bulges with the remains of an ogre that it recently swallowed, half digested.
    

- To the right: There lies a fallen knight, seemingly struck in battle and crawled beneath an oak tree where he succumbed to his wounds. Human with barely growing black hair and scorch marks along his left side, his arm is charred to a stump. 
    

- He has two potions of fire resistance on him and an empty one in his bag.
    
- Rolled loot otherwise
    

On the large natural pillar, there lies the cannibalistic behir that did all this damage, sleeping off its wounds, and its prey. This one reaches 42 ft in length and will ambush whoever it can.

-- ENCOUNTER: Cannibalistic Behir

A massive crocodilian-serpent like form stretches down from the outcropping, all 12 of its legs clutching the rock silently. Dried blood coats the outside of its misshapen mouth, riddled with crystalline teeth. Its hide seems to be reinforced with crystal-like growths protruding from its armored plates. It rears its head and strikes.

- Behir: 448 HP, can use a bonus action at the end of its turn to devour a chunk of the dead behir’s corpse, instantly recharging its breath attack, but only if it did not use its breath weapon on that turn.
    
- There is a crystal-like growth on its back just before its neck starts. The crystal has an AC of 18 and 100HP and can be damaged directly. Once destroyed, the behir loses its buffs described below.
    
- While the crystal is undestroyed:
    

- When attacked from the crystalline hide on its back, the behir has an AC of 20
    
- When attacked from its thick underhide, damage it takes is reduced by 10.
    
- The Behir has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
    

- A swallowed creature feels a sludgy mass of metal and bone as it is moved into the behir’s gullet. It can reach out and feel for Syr Lannister’s Dragonslayer Longsword as its object interaction. Note: Behirs are not dragons.
    
- Monster manual notes
    

  

In the Behir’s stomach (loot): 

The corpse of Syr Lannister, the halfling’s remains are almost entirely dissolved after being in the stomach for half a day. All that remains are the bones and the metals of his armor.

The Behir’s hide is riddled with various gems and fine materials. The crystal on its back can be identified (DC 17) as a Behir Pearl. If undestroyed it is worth 1000 Gp to the right buyer. Checks will grant various gems from the hide of the behir if properly scoured.

- DC 14: 6 Azurite gems, an opaque, mottled deep blue (10gp each)
    
- DC 17: 4 Large Jade shards, a translucent, light green (100gp each)
    
- DC 22: A large Blue Spinel has formed just under the right horn, a transparent, deep blue gem (600Gp)
    

  

STEINEFNI MINING OUTPOST

The Steinefni Mining Company is a hidden mining outpost that prevents access to the Ethfalian Caverns.

You follow the now gushing torrent of water up an incline. There are jagged rocks on the riverbank that make climbing possible, and they inevitably lead to a wide plateau that ends in a sheer cliff face with multiple bluffs and ledges, each sporting their own waterfall, cascading into a massive face of water.**
