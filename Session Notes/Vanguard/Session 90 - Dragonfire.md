## Introduction
---
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- [[Kanan Einzbern]] and [[Caede]], chosen of [[The Raven Queen]] have made the long and arduous journey across the [[Faults of North Estravia]], passing through small mountain villages, across a great ancient stone highway, and hopping across a great spiderweb of chasms that score the land
- Before leaving the faults, the pair, accompanied by the legendary monster hunter [[Rudolph van Richten]], found a small dwarven travelling company, making friends with members of the [[Battlehammer Clan]].
- Alongside the dwarves, the battled their way through the forward fortification of a Duergar fortress of some kind, where they learned that a clan known as the [[Sunblight Clan|Sunblighters]] have been mining a material known as [[Black Ice]].
- After parting ways with the dwarven prospectors, the pair found their way, led by Kanan's visions, into and through the cursed chasms of the land. It was there that they came across the remains of an ancestor of Kanan's, and reclaimed his remains and the remains of those he was protecting, as well as his staff, for a proper burial.
- Now, the group ventures ever onwards north, as the darkness of winter sets in around them, and the temperature drops lower and lower.

Have them roll and see who is highest, highest roll goes first as Theord.

### Opening Monologue
> Your name is [[Theord the Outlander]]. For years you and your homestead have endured harsh winters and a difficult life here in the Western Plateaus of [[Maghlas Mountains]]. But despite the dangers, it is home, and you love it here. You love the life living among the villages of the surrounds. As a logger you have work year-round, and you are strong by virtue of your trade and the difficult life you live.
> 
> The day is the 13th of *Dul'ussahn*, 813, and you are shaken awake by shouting outside of your home.

# Giant Raid on [[Theord Homestead]]
---
[[Theord the Outlander]], a level 3 barbarian, and his nieghbour [[Daurgi the Herdsman]], a level 3 ranger, are awoken in the night when their goats and beasts of burden are startled by a raid of giants, aiming to steal their winter stores from them.

##### **ENCOUNTER** — Ogres x 2 and frost giant
The pair of outlanders will need to defend their home from a pair of ogres that are trying to steal goats from a pen beside the two A-frame houses during a **blizzard**.

As combat grows dire, a frost giant will lumber into view, then either Kanan or Caede will appear and save the two.

### [[Theord Homestead]]
Loggers village. In a blizzard and there are a few smaller houses as well as pens for animals.

The valley ahead is far gentler than the [[Faults of North Estravia]], with rises and dips along hillsides, and fir tree forests stretching around the regions. The frigid winds only get stronger as Winter sets her roots in the bones of the land.
# Warcry of the [[Flamebrands]]
---
> The sounds of... singing of some kind echo through the valley. A war chant, slow, simple. But then from over the ridge, a streak of vibrant crimson flows, trailing ember and smoke. Cutting the sky with a roar like thunder. A lean body of muscle, unscarred, a beautiful, vibrant red the likes of which you're unsure you've seen before, and rows of teeth. 
> 
> Not to mention the fire trailing from its mouth.

On a plateau covered in snow in a clearing within a small forest of fir trees [[Gaz the Branded]] and his [[Flamebrands]] have set a trap in order to trap the [[Young Red Dragon]] [[Bloodmaw]]. What Gaz is hoping for, and what he has not yet told his soldiers, is that he hopes this will draw out [[Oriothar the Monarch]].
##### **Encounter** - Young Red Dragon and [[Oriothar the Monarch|Old Whitehorn]]
**Oriothar** has 768 hit points, as well as greatwyrm scales -4 per damage instance, and the **young red dragon** has 445 hit points, or 534 if its going too fast.

If the battle begins to go south, Oriothar will realize that the obsession that [[Gaz the Branded|Gaz]] has with him will lead to more deaths than he can inflict here, so he will allow the dwarf to survive. Worst case scenario, Oriothar will flee with his life.

**Initiatives:**
- (4) [[Gaz the Branded]], statblock of Thwad Underbrew modified
- (10 [[Borthi son of Tingor]], War priest will play a supportive role with spells like Crusader's Mantle and hold monster
- (7, 5 and 13) 9 x [[Flamebrands Statblock|Flamebrands]] Are the grunts 
- (13) Young red dragon
- (17) [[Oriothar the Monarch|Old Whitehorn]]
- Van Richten - Protect the horses

# Hike to the Battle
---
Flamebrands will be hauling their things on a large ornate bridge which allows them to move wounded and their weapons all at once. Dur
# Siege
---
### [[Infernoguard Tower]]
The Infernoguard Tower has 18 HP and 150 hit points, with the "greater toughness" condition, meaning it takes no damage from sources of 50 or less. Once it prevents 100 points of fire damage it can cast disintegrate on the biggest problem on the field, but its more flavoured like a big thingy.

##### **ENCOUNTER** - Oriothar's Forces
- (9) Fire Giant
- (21) 15 x Orc Blitzers (minions) - *up to five in one group attack*
- (6) 5 x orc war chiefs
