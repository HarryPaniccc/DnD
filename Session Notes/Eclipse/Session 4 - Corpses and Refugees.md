**Previous Session:** [[Session 3 - Fleeing the City]]
**Subsequent Session:** 

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past days, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Fighting their way through the sewers of the beseiged city of [[Nethendell]], our band of adventurers came across a new ally in the form of [[Douglas Dier]], trapped by a nest of phase spiders.
- After following [[Ignis|Ignis']] understandings of the underground sewer system, the group came across a wounded knight, dressed in quality plate and wielding a magical blade
- The knight named himself [[General Den'rael]], a man sworn to [[King Trygon]]. He claimed to have been a part of the council of [[Lord Eskel Termon]], and has been helping refugees escape the city for the past few days.
- After giving you the edict that you must find a mage named [[Tira Stone]] and deliver to her a message: "The blood wavers when the storm approaches", and then gave you an opening to fly from the city by leading a group of hobgoblin raiders away.
- Now, after camping in the woods, you follow a silver falcon, hoping this to be some kind of sign that could lead you to safety.

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are cold, an old forest that has in its bones an ancient stillness. The damp, fresh air is disrupted by the smell of decay and blood from up ahead. Just 40 feet away from you, a pack of flesh-starved undead, ghouls, feast on the corpses of fallen refugees. One things for certain, your path ahead cuts right through where the ghouls feast, but they have not seen you yet.
> 
> The day is the 12th of *Vanadrahs*, 813, and you are holding your breath, as you prepare how to deal with the threat of the ghouls up ahead.


# Session Start

---
### Encounter: Ghouls
- 11 x Ghouls (MM25)
### Refugee Corpses
You count a family of 6, plus two more who appear to be unrelated. Cut down and robbed of their valuables.

**Two draft horses** can be spotted, without saddles, nearby. They are skittish though, and require a DC 12 animal handling check to get them to come over.

### Encounter: Bandits

### Encounter: Specters in the night if I feel like it (5 max) REMEMBER they need to make it to the mine this session.

# Refugee Camp
---
The entrance is guarded by two well-armed men allied with [[General Den'rael]], overseeing valunteer guards on shifts. Not soldiers, these men are standing watch as a necessity.
### Bug's Nest
- There are nests of Ankhegs in the mines.
### [[Tira Stone]]
Established in what would once have been the operations office of the mine, Tira has a map laid out of the region.

> "What of the riders we sent to [[Castle Sungrand]]?"
> "None have returned, ma'am. We can only assume the worst. Our best hope is that they at least made it to [[Lord Margit]]'s halls before they were lost."
> "That is only if he is willing to provide aide. The man is no coward, but I find it unlikely that he won't try to profit from this. He has wanted to rule the valley for some time now. How many more came in today?"
> "Thirty three, ma'am."
> "More every day. Feeding them is going to be come a problem soon enough. You are dismissed. Go relieve Trayton and the men at the gate."
> "Yes, ma'am."

There are two high elves in the room with her, surveying the map.
- [[Hadran]], wearing quality steel plate with a shield and a heavy hammer, of fine elven craftsmanship. He has long black hair and green eyes.
- [[Atara]], wearing mithril half plate, nearly form fitting metal armour, and abeautiful bow over her shoulders. She has neatly woven blonde hair and deep brown eyes.

What she knows
- [[Lord Margit]] is the leader of castle Sungrand and has yet to provide aide to the refugees. Two riders have been sent for their aide, and were expected back the day before.
- Upon hearing the phrase "The blood wavers when the storm approaches", she will understand what [[General Den'rael]] meant.

### Parcival's Retinue
- [[Heathcliff Grimbourne]], Squire is a blue dragonborn related no him
- [[Alfred Pickleworth]], gnome servant and "Butt-ler"
- [[Tom 'Tomato' De'cuare]], human groom

# Branching Paths
---
- Go to [[Castle Sungrand]] and petition [[Lord Margit]] for aide
- Seek the temple
