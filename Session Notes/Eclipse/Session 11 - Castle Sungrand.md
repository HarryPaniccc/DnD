## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Last session these things happened
- This is important because
- And then this

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).


# Pre-Session Plan
- They encounter a party of travelling scouts sent to patrol and skirmish around the forest near [[Castle Sungrand]]
- The group is brought through the battlegrounds surrounding the castle
- Introduction to the castle and its town (think Keep on the Borderlands)
- [[Canon Valaris]] is "advising" [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] to take no action and aid no one
- They are told to fuck off
- Snooping results in Canon having **Wraiths** sent after the party in the night
- 

# Margit's Scouts
---
On the road, a **knight** will lead two veterans and seven guards, three of which have pikes instead of spears and shields.

### What the soldiers know
- **Garette** is the captain of the expidition. He belives that [[Kalir Windguard]] fled the castle, defying [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] in order to gain some upper hand on the [[Khalar'hok]]
- The soldiers all believe Kalir is dead or fled as a coward. He was a great leader and would have been useful, but the general must have been disposed of or fled when she saw the odds.

> [[Kalir Windguard]], hero of Sungrand, had heard of the approaching masses once [[Pallidmoore]] had been attacked. She, as well as her allies and adventuring companions, set out to learn more about the oncoming threat. [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] allowed her to go, but not engage, under orders of [[Canon Valaris]].

# Castle Sungrand
---
[[Castle Sungrand]] is currently under lockdown. Under the region two ish hexes around the castle, and the perimeter of the forest, is patrolled by squads of soldiers under the command of [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]].

The guards of Castle Sungrand are well trained soldiers, so they will fight in rank as best they can in order to control a battle field. They also have the *pack tactics* trait. Armed soldiers guard checkpoints on the road and smaller watchtowers within 2 hexes of the castle. Typically a squad is a group of five guards and one or two veterans.

### The Castle Grounds
The walls of the castle stand some 15 feet tall at most places, with an inner balcony and positions for archers. The castle itself is surrounded by a thick, marshy moat, bridged by a think wooden walkway that can easily be collapsed. The grounds are well kept and inside there are the signs of life that come with any equipped army: soldiers running drills, pigs and chickens minding their feed, horses being tended to.

The inner walls are taller, as the outer appears to have been erected to surround the homes in recent years. The inner keep is impressive and entirely stone, with a steel portcullis that can fall over large wooden doors. The small size of the fortress makes it clear to anyone that it is very defensible, especially given the mounted soldiers and those running formation.

# Spies Within the Walls
---
[[Canon Valaris]] is acting as an advisor to [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]]'s army

##### **ENCOUNTER**: Wraith assasins - 3 X Wraiths in the night
The wraiths are [[Kalir Windguard]] and her followers. She still wears her [[Ring of Protection]], making her harder to slay. The wraiths will attack at midnight.
