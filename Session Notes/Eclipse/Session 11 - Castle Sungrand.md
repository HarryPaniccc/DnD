## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Having almost completely traversed through the forest of [[Arden's Vale]], our group of heroes now finds themselves camping for what should be their final night at the edge of the woods before making their approach to their destination: [[Castle Sungrand]]
- Having fled the now cleared out fortress of [[Vraath Keep]], escaping with a new ally in tow, a wood elf who introduced himself as [[Swift]], the party set up camp for the evening.
- Now, during one of the watches at night, with a nearly full moon overhead, there are sounds of approaching boots in the darkness.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are lit by the cool light of the moon overhead, the stars surrounding her in her majesty. The calmness of the evening is almost intoxicating, but one thing is for certain. You are not going to be alone for very long.
> 
> The day is the 15th of Vanadrahs, 813, and you are awake.


# Pre-Session Plan
- They encounter a party of travelling scouts sent to patrol and skirmish around the forest near [[Castle Sungrand]]
- The group is brought through the battlegrounds surrounding the castle
- Introduction to the castle and its town (think Keep on the Borderlands)
- [[Canon Valaris]] is "advising" [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] to take no action and aid no one
- They are told to fuck off
- Snooping results in Canon having **Wraiths** sent after the party in the night
- [[Cened]] will sense an aura of loss trailing from [[Swift]]
- 

# Margit's Scouts
---
On the road, a **knight** will lead two veterans and seven guards, three of which have pikes instead of spears and shields.

### What the soldiers know
- **Garette** is the captain of the expidition. He belives that [[Kalir Windguard]] fled the castle, defying [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] in order to gain some upper hand on the [[Khalar'hok]]. Garette is a devout worshipper of [[Bahamut]], and will notice [[Parcival Grimbourne]]'s symbol.
- The soldiers all believe Kalir is dead or fled as a coward. He was a great leader and would have been useful, but the general must have been disposed of or fled when she saw the odds.

> [[Kalir Windguard]], hero of Sungrand, had heard of the approaching masses once [[Pallidmoore]] had been attacked. She, as well as her allies and adventuring companions, set out to learn more about the oncoming threat. [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] allowed her to go, but not engage, under orders of [[Canon Valaris]].

# Castle Sungrand
---
> The approach to the castle gives you a view of the defences for a long while. Surrounding the fortress, the once meadow-like fields have been ruined by the boots of soldiers and horses. Destroyed carriages and battlements, the signs of week-old battle sites, and discared equipment, too ruined to be worth anything litter the region.
> 
> Further along is the piles of corpses, some burnt, otherse wounded beyond repair, a mix of Nethendellian warriors and Khalarhok raiders. All rotten. Some of the lines are two or three bodies tall. You even spot the forms of putrid corpse eater ghouls, hunched over, grey-skinned undead, feasting on the decaying flesh of the fallen.
> 
> The castle's outer walls themselves are well defended, surrounded by a thick, marshy moat, and patrolled by dozens of archer lookouts. A thin, collapsable, wooden bridge takes you up an incline to a raised entryway, guarded by a portcullis, with a checkpoint of a few dozen guards keeping watch on those entering and exiting the keep's grounds. Another set of higher, inner walls exists deeper into the keep.
> 
> The grounds are well kept and inside there are the signs of life that come with any equipped army: soldiers running drills, pigs and chickens minding their feed, horses being tended to. Surprisingly, there are a large number of wooden houses and refugee tents here, and a sizeable civilian population going about their lives trading with one another and committing themselves to their trades, mostly in service to helping the Lord's army.

[[Castle Sungrand]] is currently under lockdown. Under the region two ish hexes around the castle, and the perimeter of the forest, is patrolled by squads of soldiers under the command of [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]].

The guards of Castle Sungrand are well trained soldiers, so they will fight in rank as best they can in order to control a battle field. They also have the *pack tactics* trait. Armed soldiers guard checkpoints on the road and smaller watchtowers within 2 hexes of the castle. Typically a squad is a group of five guards and one or two veterans.

### The Castle Grounds
The walls of the castle stand some 15 feet tall at most places, with an inner balcony and positions for archers. The castle itself is surrounded by a thick, marshy moat, bridged by a think wooden walkway that can easily be collapsed. The grounds are well kept and inside there are the signs of life that come with any equipped army: soldiers running drills, pigs and chickens minding their feed, horses being tended to.

The inner walls are taller, as the outer appears to have been erected to surround the homes in recent years. The inner keep is impressive and entirely stone, with a steel portcullis that can fall over large wooden doors. The small size of the fortress makes it clear to anyone that it is very defensible, especially given the mounted soldiers and those running formation.

# Spies Within the Walls
---
[[Canon Valaris]] is acting as an advisor to [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]]'s army

##### **ENCOUNTER**: Wraith assasins - 3 X Wraiths in the night
The wraiths are [[Kalir Windguard]] and her followers. She still wears her [[Ring of Protection]], making her harder to slay. The wraiths will attack at midnight.
