**Vanadrahs 12th**
- The party begins to follow a silver falcon, likely sent by Tira in order to lead stragglers to a safe haven

- Furthering their travel, avoiding the main road, the group comes across a fallen group of refugees, being feasted on a group of ghouls.

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past dayys, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- The raid on the town of [[Nethendell]] has driven our band of adventurers, warriors and vagabonds into the dungeon networks below the city.
- There, wandering from chamber to chamber hoping to find a way out, the group dispatched with a groups of goblins, orcs, and bugbears, freeing a few slaves in the process.
- Now, attempting to avoid any further confrontations after a day of exhausting fighting, the group decided to head through the networks of sewers beneath the city. It was there that they encountered a man bound by thick strands of spider webs, as well as his captors, a nest of phase spiders.
- After freeing this man - a mage of some sorts, they dispatched of the massive arachnids.
### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are wet and bilious. Getting a good look around for the first time in this room, the walls are decorated with the enwebbed corpses of townsfolk, small animals, even a few kobolds - tiny draconic human-like creatures.
> 
> One thing is for certain, Douglas, without the sudden appearance of the strangers before you, you would have wound up like the men and woman bound to the walls - prey to the spiders whose corpses now decorate the floor.
> 
> The day is the 11th of *Vanadrahs*, 813, and you are tired.

# Session Start
Ideas for what should happen
### For Francois (Looting the [[Phase Spider]]s)
https://www.thievesguild.cc/harvest/creature.php?id=470
- [[Phase Spider Poison]] (harvesting from venom)

# Phase Spider Lair
---
**Loot**
There 5 humanoid corpses: two paupers, what looks to be a dwarven worker of some kind, and one in what once would have been valuable clothing, had it not rotted away. **The last of them** is what appears to be a man wearing hardened studded leather, since ruined by ages. He looks to have been a monster hunter of sorts, and his longsword sits stil in its sheathe at his side. Inside it is the magical shortsword, [[Wastehunter]].

> The blade itself seems unmarred by whatever amount of time has passed since it was lost down here. The weapon is curved slightly, the cutting edge well sharpened, and the flat of the blade has beautiful filigree.

# Lord Den'rael
---
[[General Den'rael]] will either be wounded in a sewer.

> Ahead, you hear the sound heavy breathing, like someone trying to catch their breath. It's masked, the man is certainly wearing a heavy helm of some kind. A strange pale light is cast on the walls surrounding the intersection, bright and constant, like a magic light, but sharded, in fragments. And moving, scattering along the wall.

What he knows
- The lord was a part of [[Lord Eskel Termon]]'s council when the attack came
- He left to command the defenses but was too late, they were overwhelmed when he arrived at the gates.
- He has been trying to return to the Tormon keep but only got close enough to see it is still holding out
- Tell [[Tira Stone]] "The blood wavers when the storm approaches".
- His men will be led by Tira

"For king Trygon!"

# Leaving the City
---
Hawk sees them and guides them away

- Reach level 5

> From the outer fields surrounding Nethendell the scale of the damage is evident. Half the city is awash with the smoke of dead fires, the that you can see are all un-hinged or destroyed in one way or another. The more keen eyed among you, too, from your vantage point, can make out in the night on the other end of the city, the lights of a large warcamp, maybe two hours away from nethendell itself.

### Hawk of Hope
In the evening, a silver-looking falcon will fly overhead. This falcon is the familiar of [[Tira Stone]], sent to guide refugees to teh mountains west of Nethendell, to a hidden, abandoned mine.

# Travel to the Mines
---
### Encounter: Ghouls

### Encounter: Bandits

### Encounter: Galeb Duhr

### Encounter: Wraiths in the night

# Refugee Camp
---
The entrance is guarded by two well-armed men allied with [[General Den'rael]], overseeing valonteer guards on shifts. Not soldiers, these men are standing watch as a necessity.
### Bug's Nest
- There are nests of Ankhegs in the mines.
### [[Tira Stone]]
Established in what would once have been the operations office of the mine, Tira has a map laid out of the region.

> "What of the riders we sent to [[Castle Sungrand]]?"
> "None have returned, ma'am. We can only assume the worst. Our best hope is that they at least made it to [[Lord Margit Tormon]]'s halls before they were lost."
> "That is only if he is willing to provide aide. The man is no coward, but I find it unlikely that he won't try to profit from this. He has wanted to rule the valley for some time now. How many more came in today?"
> "Thirty three, ma'am."
> "More every day. Feeding them is going to be come a problem soon enough. You are dismissed. Go relieve Trayton and the men at the gate."
> "Yes, ma'am."

There are two high elves in the room with her, surveying the map.
- [[Hadran]], wearing quality steel plate with a shield and a heavy hammer, of fine elven craftsmanship. He has long black hair and green eyes.
- [[Atara]], wearing mithril half plate, nearly form fitting metal armour, and abeautiful bow over her shoulders. She has neatly woven blonde hair and deep brown eyes.

What she knows
- [[Lord Margit Tormon]] is the leader of castle Sungrand and has yet to provide aide to the refugees. Two riders have been sent for their aide, and were expected back the day before.
- Upon hearing the phrase "The blood wavers when the storm approaches", she will understand what [[General Den'rael]] meant.

### Parcival's Retinue
- [[Heathcliff Grimbourne]], Squire is a blue dragonborn related no him
- [[Alfred Pickleworth]], gnome servant and "Butt-ler"
- [[Tom 'Tomato' De'cuare]], human groom

# Branching Paths
---
- Go to [[Castle Sungrand]] and petition [[Lord Margit Tormon]] for aide
- Seek the temple
