### How do I win?


---

You dont, we do.
> If you had fun, I had fun

Notes: its about your character as much as it is about you. What would your character do? How does your character win? Kanan Einzbern, last of his line and hunter of evil, doesn't care about XP or getting cool items. He just wants to avenge his family. That is how you win dnd. You tell a good story

Player vs DM

![[Pasted image 20250414132345.png|600]]

- I am not your enemy
- DMs are players too
- We are all in the car, I just choose the music

Notes: This leads on to a dangerous misconception that I wanted to adress before we get playing. The DM is not your enemy, Im not an opponent to be beaten. Believe me, if I wanted to kill your characters, it would be unfathomably easy. But it wouldn't be fun. Or rewarding. Im here to help you tell a good story. I won't try to kill you, but Vecna, the lich god of secrets? He will try. Its my job to make his attempt entertaining.
