**Previous Session:** [[Session 4 - Corpses and Refugees]]
**Subsequent Session:** [[Session 6 - A Den of Chitin]]
## Post Mortem

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past days, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- 

### Opening Monologue

> The evening air you find yourself in is busy. In its own tense way, it feels good to know that at least some people managed to escape from the city. As a group, you sit in your own corner carved in the refugee camp around a fire that you have built, enjoying a simple meal. One thing is for certain, however. The tension that hangs over the camp cannot be dispelled, and regardless of how safe you might try to convince yourself that you are, you know the danger of the foe that hunts you.
> 
> The day is the 12th of *Vanadrahs*, 813.


# Session Start
- [[Cened]] chats with the elves
- [[Parcival Grimbourne]]'s retinue finds him

# Refugee Camp
---
The entrance is guarded by two well-armed men allied with [[General Den'rael]], overseeing valunteer guards on shifts. Not soldiers, these men are standing watch as a necessity.

### [[Parcival Grimbourne|Parcival's]] Retinue
>"Your retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused."
- [[Heathcliff Grimbourne]], Squire is a blue dragonborn related no him (Young man)
- [[Alfred Pickleworth]], gnome servant and "Butt-ler" (Alfred's accent)
- [[Tom 'Tomato' De'cuare]], human groom (Rick's Tommy accent)

### Highelf Guardians
[[Hadran]] and [[Atara]] make their camp on one of the apexes overlooking the mine, in the cool air of the evening.

**What the elves know**
- During the wars of the fall, it is known that the elves of the city of [[Qel-Annura]] formed an alliance with the men of the north, the modern day [[Unnamed Stark House Equivalent]], in order to protect battle back the evils that plagued the region at the time. They are a member of a conclave that have acted as guardians of holy sites to [[Sehanine]] in the area. Most are well hidden, and if only they could offer more protection to the people than they can currently afford, but the secrets of their location cannot be revealed.
- The [[Mirror of Liraleth]] is hidden somewhere in the valley. The pair worry that the enemy is trying to find it.
- They are departing in the morning.

# Abandoned Mine

![[Pasted image 20250701181726.png]]
## 1. Entrance Crevasse
> Entrance and Guardian

The chamber looks to be a central mining shaft, with collapsed tunnels once used by the mine's constructors. Other than once-square carved tunnels leading in three directions, two of which are now collapsed to the left, there are a number of somewhat smoothe tunnels leading into the rockface, some as large as 3 meters across. Notably, there is a large fissure in the wall that leads into darkness, covered in some kind of sticky substance. 

- It takes an action to squeeze through the fissure. Once three people have squeezed through, a pair of ankehgs will attack, will appear in front of the group and the other end.

### Encounter: Ankheg Ambush x 2
2 x Ankhegs attack the group. (Initiatives 19 and 9)

## 2. Navigating The Nest
> Puzzle/Roleplaying Challenge

## 3. Roper Breeding Room
> Trick or Setback
### Encounter: Roper Mimic Combo
A Roper, a Mimic, and 3 swarms of Maggots
A roper sits above a swarm of maggots and a mimic

**Loot:** 
- The mimic holds stuff from its previous victims: 175 gp, 53 sp, a [[Chime of Opening]] and a **scroll of ray of sickness**.
- In the infestation of larvae there sits the corpse of a drow. There is barely noticable drow architecture around the area.
## 4. Ankheg Nest
> Climax, Big Battle, or Conflict
- 2 ankhegs
- Boss ankheg (120 hp)

**Loot**:
- A small chest that looks as though it was being transported by a small caravan of guards. DC 15 lockpicking to open. Within, lying on a bed of 84 gold pieces, sits a masterworked, carved of chitin ivory, [[Dagger of Acid]]. The handle is ivory, and runes decorate the cutting edge.
## 5. Bulette Hunting Ground
> Reward, Revelation, Twist

Pathways to this room are covered in a thick layer of waxy substance, sealing up pathways in that direction. There is a shrine to [[Lolth]] and some kind of lolthy thing there, being watched by a Bulette.

**Loot**:
- A scroll of *conjure animals* that summons two giant spiders
