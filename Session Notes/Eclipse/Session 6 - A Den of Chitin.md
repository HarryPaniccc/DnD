**Previous Session:** [[Session 5 - Into the Mines]]
**Subsequent Session:** [[Session 7 - ]]
## Introduction
> "This is the legend of the Vanguard" or some kind of blurb. MAYBE do sequential lyrics to the sun the moon the stars or something.
> 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Last session these things happened
- This is important because
- And then this

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the nth of *month*, 813, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).

## 1. Entrance Crevasse
> Entrance and Guardian

The chamber looks to be a central mining shaft, with collapsed tunnels once used by the mine's constructors. Other than once-square carved tunnels leading in three directions, two of which are now collapsed to the left, there are a number of somewhat smoothe tunnels leading into the rockface, some as large as 3 meters across. Notably, there is a large fissure in the wall that leads into darkness, covered in some kind of sticky substance. 

- It takes an action to squeeze through the fissure. Once three people have squeezed through, a pair of ankehgs will attack, will appear in front of the group and the other end.

### Encounter: Ankheg Ambush x 2

## 5. Bulette Hunting Ground
> Reward, Revelation, Twist

Pathways to this room are covered in a thick layer of waxy substance, sealing up pathways in that direction. There is a shrine to [[Lolth]] and some kind of lolthy thing there, being watched by a Bulette.

**Loot**:
- A scroll of *conjure animals* that summons two giant spiders
