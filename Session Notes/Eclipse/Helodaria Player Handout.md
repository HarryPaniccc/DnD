# The World
**Welcome to Helodaria.** A world of magic and blades and monsters. The history of this world is one of sorcery and Gods, ascension and ruin. 

The world around you is unknown. Points of light connected by trade routes may give the merchants some feeling of security. A false sense that they know the edges of the map just as well as anyone can. But in reality, the wars of **The Fall** centuries ago caused the loss of more than life.

Since then, various empires and kingdoms have sprouted anew or rebuilt out of the rubble of what was. The Empire of Zitrumea and her royal houses control most of the prime continent bearing the same name. The Kingdom of Sirkonos, the City of Desseran and the Republic of Ruina all seat themselves across the continent of Eranulaid to the north, growing from the ruins of an old empire once sundered by hubris and heresy. The Republic of Pyleas, stretched across the Southern Zitrumean seas and its archipelago is a home to many peoples and expressions, philosophers and athletes. The Sundance Isles and their waters governed by the law of the sword and the avarice of the captains who claim them as their home.

The setting is a meant to be an accomodating fantasy land. If you can imagine it fitting into Skyrim, the Witcher, World of Warcraft (to some extent), Lord of the Rings, or Castlevania, it will likely fit into Helodaria. Why is my gun-slinging cowboy fighting a frost giant in the elemental realm of ice? Well I don't know, lets figure it out, that sure sounds like a great adventure!

# Rules
We will be playing dungeons and dragons 5th edition, published by Wizards of the Coast. Just to clear up some confusion, Wizards did publish a revision to the core 5th edition rules in 2024, but neglected to rename the version or provide any kind of distinction between the two as far as edition name goes. The version I plan on running for is the 2014 edition of 5th edition. All of the rules are available on https://2014.5e.tools/, and I also highly encourage people to read through the basic rules on dnd beyond here https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014, but you can get away with just showing up.

I don't, however, encourage the use of the dndbeyond toolset. In fact, I simply don't run for characters whose character sheets are exclusively on beyond. It makes learning the rules take a while, it has consistently incorrect rule descriptions in my experience, the UI is really janky for many features, and making a character is actually really easy.

# Character Creation
Im down to put an hour or two aside sometime to just sit and get the characters created. One thing that can really sort of slow things down is the player decision making process: if you know you want to play "Ugthak" the Orc barbarian, an experienced player can generate the character sheet in like 10 minutes, but sitting and considering what your character is going to be will be a more arduous and personal journey, and sadly one that I have little control over.

If you want to ask any questions about my world or about how your character might fit in, please just DM me. This is my main passtime and I will literally spend hours talking about it if it means you are having fun when the dice start rolling.

What makes a "good" character? Three things, really: They must be fun for you to play, they must be fun to DM for, and they must be fun for the other players at the table to play with.

# Playing the Game
I am your dungeon master, I am not your opponent. This is an incredibly important concept that must be dispelled or prevented from taking root. If you have fun, I have fun. But that also means that I need to know what you are thinking/planning/considering for your characters or in your session. I don't mind being tactically outplayed in combat, hell if you don't think things through I will just murder your character. But I am here to ensure you have an enjoyable, climactic time. And I also need to ensure that you get to play the fantasy that you want to play, so long as it is fun for me, fun for you, and fun for the other players at the table.
