# Plot Summary
The town of [[Nethendell]] sits on the southern side of the pass that separates the northern [[Zitrumea]] regions from the central. Living in the shadow of the [[Tower of Yierdur]], the people of Nethendell have lived a peaceful life. The town is built above an ancient temple to [[Sehanine]].

Talk of Orcs in the surrounding hills have sent a stir among the townsfolk, and though the lord vassal of Nethendell has fallen ill, his son, [[Lord Eskel Termon]], has assured the townsfolk of safety. A false hope, as the village of [[Pallidmoore]] near the town fell to an army of goblins, and now the town has come under seige by the same army, the [[Khalar'hok]], lead by [[Bloodlord Mehron]] with whome Eskel is in league.

Eskel and Mehron seek the [[Mirror of Liraleth]], a source of power said once to be wielded by an elven warrior during the wars of the fall, so that they might corrupt it to use it as a #TODO . Ki Rin pair, one is taken and the other needs help

Now with Nethendell under seige, the survivors fled to a forgotten mine in a mountain overlooking the valley. Related, a small sect of [[Sehanine]] worshipper elves stalk the land in hiding, maintaining small temples and such to ensure that the mirror remains hidden.

> Lesser house under [[Unnamed Stark House Equivalent]] are vassals of this region, and lord 

### Further Notes
**Points of Interest**:

- [[Mirror of Liraleth]]
- [[Conclave Temple]] - location where the sehanine conclave sit
- [[Tower of Yierdur]]
- [[Pallidmoore]]

# Act 1
The group start in a ransacked town and fight their way out, looking to find some kind of bearing on the world. This act will have them escaping [[Nethendell]] and finding [[Tira Stone]] and helping the refugees get set up, and maybe holding off against a seige. They will need to petition [[Lord Margit Tormon]] for shelter. Use the black iron pact stats for [[Lord Eskel Termon]] and friends.
- Escape
- Find [[Tira Stone]]
- Help survivors + people
- Castle guys need to help
- Maybe make petitioning
