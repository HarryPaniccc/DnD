### Plot Ideas
- Hired to go kill some guys but then set up to be killed and now its a revenge plot against someone. Maybe set in [[Ralia]] where a local lord has been murdered, or rather a smaller town
- In Dularen involving the [[Church of the Unshackled]] has become corrupted with followers of [[Thezuurol]] or similar
### Going with
- Town controlled by some kind of vassal whos son keeps him poisoned and controls the town like wormtongue. Before the town was raided by goblinoids who were 'defeated' but fled with the real heir captive.
- People have been attacked/killed on the surrounding farmlands
- Hag fight somewhere I guess
### Jana's Ideas
- Cute talking animal (baby lamb) becomes part of group at some point it sacrifices itself (masculine urge last stand, gruesome death) (Respawnable lamb): The murderer did it not out of hunger, but malice
- Small pond (unassuming from outside) if someone goes in its deep as hell and it leads to stuff on the sides. Little dudes/magical light. Vertical water fight. Something sireny
- Exclaimed "Ooh" At gibbering mouther
- Disappearing cathedral(?)
- Magic sword that makes the cut curl up/warp what it is cutting
