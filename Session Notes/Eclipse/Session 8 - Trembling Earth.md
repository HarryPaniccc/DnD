## Post Mortem
**Vanadrahs 13th**
- The party defeated a Bulette while exploring the entrance to the [[Underdark]] at the end of the Ankheg nest
- Once looting concluded, they returned to [[Tira Stone]] who thanked them for assisting with the danger
- She gave them access to assistance from their best equipment, and a promise of more rations, as well as four [[Potion of Healing|Potions of Healing]] that she could spare
- Tira then employed the party to seek out [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] at [[Castle Sungrand]], hoping that they might be able to petition him for aide

**Vanadrahs 14th**
- The group decide to cut through the forest in order to make it to Sungrand quicker.
- They do battle with and slay a group of Hobgoblins led by a Bugbear chief.
- After running into a Hobgoblin patrol, thr group has alerted the scouting party to their presence, and are now being persued by the [[Khalar'hok]] within the wood
## Recap
**Much has happened** these past days, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Having been commissioned to clear out the abandoned mines near the refugee camp, our group of heroes set an ambush for and managed to defeat a large group of ankhegs.
- Now, delving deeper into the nest, the party has found their way into a sealed off tunnel. A tunnel that the bugs seemed to want inaccessible.
- Here, having spied what appears to be a shrine to the spider goddess [[Lolth]], [[Cened]] was sent to investigate any potential loot that may be strewn about the altar, where she drew the ire of a subterranean predator.

### Opening Monologue
> The surrounds you find yourself in are vibrant and humid. A thin layer of lichen covers most of the rocky surrounds of the cavern, mixing colours and vibrancy like a canvass. The ground below you is hard packed earth, yet one thing is for certain. That is not stopping whatever creature that is approaching you.
> 
> The day is the 13th of *Vanadrahs*, 813, and you are facing a massive chitinous, fin-like protrusion, as it rushes its way toward you. Roll initiative.

# Session Start
- Bulette fight
- Loot the Lolth shrine
- Back on the main questline
- MAP

# Bulette + Cleaning the Mines
---
Pathways to this room are covered in a thick layer of waxy substance, sealing up pathways in that direction. There is a shrine to [[Lolth]] and some kind of lolthy thing there, being watched by a Bulette.

**Loot**:
- A scroll of *conjure animals* that summons two giant spiders
- Onyx statue of Lolth. Held at her breast is a black threaded ribbon that when carried grants +1 deception, [[Thread of Deceit]]

### Ankheg Nest loot
- A small chest that looks as though it was being transported by a small caravan of guards. DC 15 lockpicking to open. Within, lying on a bed of 84 gold pieces, sits a masterworked, carved of chitin ivory, [[Dagger of Acid]]. The handle is ivory, and runes decorate the cutting edge.

# Seek [[Lord Margit Tormon]]
---
[[Tira Stone]] will be very grateful for their efforts after defeating the ankhegs.

**Rewards**
- Their equipment will be seen to by the [[House Trygon]] soldiers should they need polishing.
- They will be fed while they are within the camp
- Once this debacle is over, the Tormon house will see to properly rewarding them.
- If they call for anything else that seems reasonable let them have it.
#### What Tira knows:
- It has been too long since sending word to [[Castle Sungrand]] to not have heard back. She believes that the riders must have been lost.
- The castle _must_ be commissioned for aid. The rangers ([[Rosmary (and Thyme)]]) she has sent out can only lead the [[Khalar'hok]] away for so long, and though the mines will improve their chances, there is no comparison to the safety of castle walls.
- She must employ the group to meet with [[Lord Margit Tormon|Margit Tormon]] of Castle Sungrand and petition him for aide.

- Two goblins + Worg mounts
- 4 Hobgoblins
- Minotaur
- Manticore

### Goblin Warcamp
Somewhere within the forest is the beginnings of an orc warcamp which [[Bloodlord Mehron]] plans to use as a staging ground to assault [[Castle Sungrand]] outside of [[Vraath Keep]] in one of the thick forest hexes. It has been established a mere two days before.

Tents are set up and the surrounding forest has begin to be harvested by the ogre and hobgoblins. An orc has been added too.
##### **ENCOUNTER** - Hobgoblin Warcamp
- Bugbear Chief + Orc Rampart + hobgoblins x 3 + Ogre (Waraxe)
The war chief is guarded by the rampart

> Note: If the party is not careful about leaving tracks, the hobgoblins will follow them.

##### **ENCOUNTER** - Hobgoblin Rangers
- 3 x Hobgoblins and a worg

# [[Castle Sungrand]]
---
The guards of Castle Sungrand are well trained soldiers, so they will fight in rank as best they can in order to control a battle field. They also have the *pack tactics* trait.

Armed soldiers guard checkpoints on the road and smaller watchtowers within 2 hexes of the castle. Typically a squad is a group of five guards and one or two veterans.

On the road, a **knight** will lead two veterans and seven guards, three of which have pikes instead of spears and shields.

### The Castle Grounds
The walls of the castle stand some 15 feet tall at most places, with an inner balcony and positions for archers. The castle itself is surrounded by a thick, marshy moat, bridged by a think wooden walkway that can easily be collapsed. The grounds are well kept and inside there are the signs of life that come with any equipped army: soldiers running drills, pigs and chickens minding their feed, horses being tended to.

The inner walls are taller, as the outer appears to have been erected to surround the homes in recent years. The inner keep is impressive and entirely stone, with a steel portcullis that can fall over large wooden doors. The small size of the fortress makes it clear to anyone that it is very defensible, especially given the mounted soldiers and those running formation.
