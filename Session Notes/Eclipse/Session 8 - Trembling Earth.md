**Previous Session:** [[Session 7 - A Den of Chitin]]
**Subsequent Session:**
## Introduction
> "This is the legend of the Vanguard" or some kind of blurb. MAYBE do sequential lyrics to the sun the moon the stars or something.
> 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Jumping right into the action, Bulette fight

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are old. Older than you, maybe older than I. But one things for certain, you are not the first to come through here recently.
> 
> The day is the 13th of *Vanadrahs*, 813, and you are falling.
