## Introduction
> Campaign into here
> 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song?

> The surrounds you find yourself in are cold, hard stone. Unforgiving and cruel. No sunlight seen these halls in hundreds of years. One thing is for certain. If you remain here, you know you will die.
>
> The day is the 11th day of the month of *Vanadras*, 813 Post Fall, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).

# Session Start
- Escape the dungeons of the city, either heading deeper through a forgotten crypt or up through the prisons/city.
- Spent the last little while hiding in a forgotten, ruined cell under the bones of the city.


# The Pit
---
> The darkness of the surrounds has become suffocating in the past days. What little light you afford yourselves illuminates the stains of dried blood on the ground and the old oak door - the only exit to the chamber. The sound of dripping water and scurrying rats has been your constant backdrop for what has likely been days.

For this section there are no sources of light, the ceiling is maybe 3 meters from the ground on average. 

Outside a hallway leads in two directions:
- Left, towards a T-junction and **stairs** that lead up to the old dungeons and sewers you escaped through
- Right, to a short hallway with a **portcullis** stuck halfway down, decorated with thick, dusty spider webs, and further into the sewer system. There are skeletal remains of someone who tried to crawl under the portcullis but got stuck in the webs. (**DC 15 investigation to find a platinum piece in his shoe**)
	- The webs are difficult terrain, and a creature entering them for the first time on a turn must succeed a **DC 12 Dex save** or become restrained. (DC 12 athletics or acrobatics action to escape). Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.
	- Beyond the portcullis the hallway continues before meeting a landing and descending down a flight of stairs. The area has clearly not been travelled by any person for a long time.
- There is a **large crack** on the wall opposite the chamber they begin in. Investigating it with a **DC 10 Investigation Check** will reveal that one of the bricks is loose within the crack behind it is a small satchel, used by a thief in case they need a getaway.
	- Two vials of basic poison
	- A 50 gp Bloodstone (opaque dark gray with red flecks)
	- 10 Sp
	- A dagger
