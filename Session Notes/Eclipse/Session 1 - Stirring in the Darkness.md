## Introduction
> Campaign into here
> 
> So we will find our dreams fade in time, and in time our dreams leave us blind. By moonlight and starlight those shadows led me astray. Take comfort in darkness, and hide away from the light

### Opening Monologue
The idea is to Pavlov's dog them into the zone. Choose an arc intro song.

> The surrounds you find yourself in are cold, hard stone. Unforgiving and cruel. No sunlight seen these halls in hundreds of years. One thing is for certain. If you remain here, you know you will die.
>
> The day is the 11th day of the month of *Vanadras*, 813 Post Fall, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).
