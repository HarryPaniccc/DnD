**Subsequent Session**: [[Session 2 - Webs in the Sewers]]
## Post Mortem
**Vanadrahs 11th, 813 PF**
- [[Ignis]], [[Togwae]], [[Parcival Grimbourne]], [[Cened]], [[Rosmary (and Thyme)]], and [[Ealendar]] have all fled below [[Nethendell]] attempting to escape the horde besieging it
- They spent some time searching the catacombs, opting to head towards the surface rather than towards the underground escape route.
- They did battle with a group of goblin scouts.
- They engaged a group of hobgoblins and an orc using slaves to sort garbage.

## Introduction
> Welcome to Zitrumea, the prime continent of the Material Plane. A vast realm dotted with kingdoms and fiefdoms, many of which united under the great empire bearing the same name as the continent. Under this banner, led by the legendary [[Baylan Zitrum]], a champion of the Creation Gods, the forces of humanity and order beat back the worshippers of the dark powers, and the deities that are now worshipped world wide sealed away or destroyed many of their treacherous, vile bretheren.
> 
> Our story finds us in the town of [[Nethendell]]. Situated in on the base of a range of mountains that segments the low north of the empire's territories, the citizens of nethendell have been stirred. Talk of orcs and goblins amassing in the hills and surrounding countryside, and the lord of Nethendell having fallen ill in recent months.
> 
> Despite is son, [[Lord Eskel Termon]], ensuring the people that the town would hold against invasion, a nearby village, known as [[Pallidmoore]], has fallen to invasion, a few survivors making their way to Nethendell. It took only days, but inevitably, the horde made its way to the larger town. The ensuing raid was a slaughter, houses being torched, people fleeing, and defences only truly beginning to hold surrounding the citymaster's manor.
### Opening Monologue

> The surrounds you find yourself in are cold, hard stone. Unforgiving and cruel. No sunlight seen these halls in hundreds of years. One thing is for certain. If you remain here, you know you will die.
>
> The day is the 11th day of the month of *Vanadras*, 813 Post Fall, and you are (bleeding/dying/chilling/eating).

# Session Start
- Escape the dungeons of the city, either heading deeper through a forgotten crypt or up through the prisons/city.
- Spent the last little while hiding in a forgotten, ruined cell under the bones of the city.

# The Pit
---
> The darkness of the surrounds has become suffocating in the past days. What little light you afford yourselves illuminates the stains of dried blood on the ground and the old oak door - the only exit to the chamber. The sound of dripping water and scurrying rats has been your constant backdrop for what has likely been days.

For this section there are no sources of light, the ceiling is maybe 3 meters from the ground on average. 

Outside a hallway leads in two directions:
- Left, towards a T-junction and **stairs** that lead up to the old dungeons and sewers you escaped through
- Right, to a short hallway with a **portcullis** stuck halfway down, decorated with thick, dusty spider webs, and further into the sewer system. There are skeletal remains of someone who tried to crawl under the portcullis but got stuck in the webs. (**DC 15 investigation to find a platinum piece in his shoe**)
	- The webs are difficult terrain, and a creature entering them for the first time on a turn must succeed a **DC 12 Dex save** or become restrained. (DC 12 athletics or acrobatics action to escape). Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.
	- Beyond the portcullis the hallway continues before meeting a landing and descending down a flight of stairs. The area has clearly not been travelled by any person for a long time.
- There is a **large crack** on the wall opposite the chamber they begin in. Investigating it with a **DC 10 Investigation Check** will reveal that one of the bricks is loose within the crack behind it is a small satchel, used by a thief in case they need a getaway.
	- Two vials of basic poison
	- A 50 gp Bloodstone (opaque dark gray with red flecks)
	- 10 Sp
	- A dagger
### Encounter: Roaming Goblins
> 4 x goblins, 1 x goblin boss

Goblins break in looking for more shit. They make a lot of noise as they make their way into the room giving the adventurers time to prepare an ambush.

# Prison Cistern
---
> The chamber ahead is lit with a warm torchlight, moving swiftly, probably many torches carried by different creatures. The room is divided into two levels: An open level on the ground with various doors facing inwards on either side. At the back a pair of two stairways lead to the same raised platform which wraps around one end overlooking the center. A small river of sewer water flows form a grate at the back of the top level, down as a waterfall and into a collection at the bottom level, before flowing into a grate on the floor. 

In a room with a raised platform with rows of prison doors on either side, at the center a grate of sewerage flows through

### Encounter: Bugbear Looters
> Bugbear Commander + Bugbears x 3 + Goblin x 2 + Orc eye of gruumsh

Goblinoids looting a store room by some cells with prisoners in them. Theyre being hounded by the goblins. A bugbear wielding a whip demands that the prison doors are opened so that the prisoners inside can be claimed as slaves.
