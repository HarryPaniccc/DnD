- Fought Phase Spiders
- Rescued [[Douglas Dier]]
### Recap
**Much has happened** these past days, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- The north eastern town of [[Nethendell]] has been besieged by hordes of goblinoids, the defenses overrun and a tide of death being unleashed upon the citizens. In an effort to find shelter, a small band warriors and travellers fled beneath a barrack's dungeon, deep into the tunnels and sewers beneath the city.
- Now, days after holing up in a small room in a forgotten section in the underground dungeons, you have decided that to remain here, is to die. Shaking in the walls and the sounds of death outside, as well as your limited access to rations has forced your hand.
- Having fought your way through a small group of goblin scouts, you decided to head upwards towards the surface, avoiding the path further into the underground ruins. Now, having skulked your way through dank, abandoned sewers and tunnels, you came upon a cistern that doubled as a prison, and, in trying to free two slaves, burst in to attack their captors. Now, a bloody battle ensues.

### Opening Monologue

> The surrounds you find yourself in are vile, the stench of sewerage and blood permeates the stone interior. The floor below you runs with excrement and bile. The metallic taste of blood fills the very air you breathe, and one thing is for certain... You are not out of this fight yet.
> 
> The day is the 11th of *Vanadrahs*, 813 PF, and your hands throb as they clutch your sword, Ealendar, as you sever the life of your orc foe.

# Session Start
End the fight from last session. Depending on who joins, throw them into one of the cells and give them very important information about how to escape.
- [[Douglas Dier]] needs to be included

# Prison Cistern
---
> The chamber ahead is lit with a warm torchlight, moving swiftly, probably many torches carried by different creatures. The room is divided into two levels: An open level on the ground with various doors facing inwards on either side. At the back a pair of two stairways lead to the same raised platform which wraps around one end overlooking the center. A small river of sewer water flows form a grate at the back of the top level, down as a waterfall and into a collection at the bottom level, before flowing into a grate on the floor. 

In a room with a raised platform with rows of prison doors on either side, at the center a grate of sewerage flows through which leads to a passageway out of town.

### Encounter: Bugbear Looters
> Bugbear Commander + Bugbears x 3 + Goblin x 2 + Orc eye of gruumsh

Goblinoids looting a store room by some cells with prisoners in them. Theyre being hounded by the goblins. A bugbear wielding a whip demands that the prison doors are opened so that the prisoners inside can be claimed as slaves.
### Loot
- The **bugbear champion** has a well made greatsword that looks to have been claimed from a knight or some officer
- Knocked on the ground surrounding the desk is a small pouch of gold (17gp, 8sp)
- A **DC 14 investigation** check reveals transparent pale blue-green cut gemstone (50gp Zircon)
- The orc has a looted [[Potion of Healing]] on his body and a well made shortsword, as well as 13gp and 12cp in looted coins.
### Prisoners
The two men that the party came to rescue are named Dorian (bald, stark green eyes) and Baldur (scraggly hair, black), both humans. Both belonged to the a band of thieves who were captured.

- **brands** on the backs of their hand identify them both as bandits (use statblock) who await sentencing, likely awaiting death anyway.
- At the first opportunity they will make a break for it

### Splitting Path
- Sewer path (phase spiders)
- Out to barracks (orc fight)


# Sewer Passageway
---
> The passageway ahead is a tight pipeway with a trickle of water at the bottom. The pipe continues straight or some time before opening into a larger sewer pathway. Unlike where you were before, this appears to be a maintenance tunnel of some kind. The ceiling overhead is only about 3 meters high, but the sense of dust is at least gone.

### Encounter: Phase Spiders + Hatchlings (Wolf spider stats)
- Double the phase spider's HP for some duration boost
- Web environmentals: The webs are difficult terrain, and a creature entering them for the first time on a turn must succeed a **DC 12 Dex save** or become restrained. (DC 12 athletics or acrobatics action to escape). Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.

[[Douglas Dier]] is wrapped in webs around the nest
# Orc Barracks
---
### Encounter: Orc revellers
> Orc War Chief + Orc Rampart + Orcs x 3 + Ogre Battering Ram + Hobgoblin Incendiarist

Worst case scenario let the knight show up and help them. [[Douglas Dier]] is in a cage nearby.
