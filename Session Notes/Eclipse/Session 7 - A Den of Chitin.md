**Previous Session:** [[Session 6 - Ambushes in the Dark]]
**Subsequent Session:** [[Session 8 - Trembling Earth]]
## Post Morten
**Vanadrahs 13th**
- Destroed the Ankheg eggs in the hatchery, summoning the three remaining Ankhegs to the hatchery chamber
- Dug their way through the hive matter towards the Bulette hunting grounds, discovering the Lolth shrine
- In an attempt to investigate it, [[Cened]] is sent to sneak up towards it, summoning the Bulette fight

## Recap
**Much has happened** these past months, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- Having been hired to clear out the abandoned mine in the refugee camp, our group of adventurers delved into the depths, seeking Ankheg blood
- After an ambush, and now attacking what looks to be a hatchery of some kind in which a roper and a mimic were lying in wait, the group identified that attacking the egg sacks along the walls would incite some kind of aggression from the denisens of the hive.
- Now, having taking time to patch themselves up, we join them again in the Den of Chitin

### Opening Monologue

> The surrounds you find yourselves in are humid, filthy. Hardened organic hive mass decorates the walls, the pungent smell of dead larvae and aberration fills the already rank chamber. One thing is for certain tough. The crawling remains, and your job is not yet finished.
> 
> The day is the 13th of *Vanadrahs*, 813, and you are staunching your wounds, some of you covered in warm, fresh blood that is either your own, or your enemies'.


# Abandoned Mine
---
![[Pasted image 20250701181726.png]]
## 1. Entrance Crevasse
> Entrance and Guardian

The chamber looks to be a central mining shaft, with collapsed tunnels once used by the mine's constructors. Other than once-square carved tunnels leading in three directions, two of which are now collapsed to the left, there are a number of somewhat smoothe tunnels leading into the rockface, some as large as 3 meters across. Notably, there is a large fissure in the wall that leads into darkness, covered in some kind of sticky substance. 

- It takes an action to squeeze through the fissure. Once three people have squeezed through, a pair of ankehgs will attack, will appear in front of the group and the other end.


## 3. Roper Hive Nest
> Trick or Setback 
## 4. Ankheg Nest
> Climax, Big Battle, or Conflict
- 2 ankhegs
- Boss ankheg (120 hp)

**Loot**: 
- A small chest that looks as though it was being transported by a small caravan of guards. DC 15 lockpicking to open. Within, lying on a bed of 84 gold pieces, sits a masterworked, carved of chitin ivory, [[Dagger of Acid]]. The handle is ivory, and runes decorate the cutting edge.
## 5. Bulette Hunting Ground
> Reward, Revelation, Twist

Pathways to this room are covered in a thick layer of waxy substance, sealing up pathways in that direction. There is a shrine to [[Lolth]] and some kind of lolthy thing there, being watched by a Bulette.

**Loot**:
- A scroll of *conjure animals* that summons two giant spiders
