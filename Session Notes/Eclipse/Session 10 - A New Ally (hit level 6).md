## Recap
**Much has happened** these past days, too much to tell now, but here is what is most important.
- During their journey to ask for help from the military fortress in the region, [[Castle Sungrand]], the party managed to acquire the attention of the scouting presence of the [[Khalar'hok]] in the forest known as [[Arden's Vale]]
- Having spent a day sculking through the forest, avoiding being detected by the goblinoid forces, the party eventually came across a small keep currently held by the enemy
- The group decided to assault the fortress and claim it for themselves. Using clever tactics and their magical items, a bloody battle broke out in which the leader of the keep, an unnammed sorcerer, fell to the power of a moonbeam. Now, the melee continues, as we return to combat

### Opening Monologue
> Overhead, the sun begins to make its way down towards the horizon. Your heart races in your ear as you clutch your weapon, now slick with the blood of your enemy. Behind you, Cened, Douglas puts his weight against the wall to steady himself.

> The day is the 15th of *Vanadrahs*, 813, and you catch your breath for another moment, as you ready yourself to kill again. It is the top of the round, and it is your turn.

### Goblin Warcamp
Somewhere within the forest is the beginnings of an orc warcamp which [[Bloodlord Mehron]] plans to use as a staging ground to assault [[Castle Sungrand]] outside of [[Vraath Keep]] in one of the thick forest hexes. It has been established a mere two days before.

Tents are set up and the surrounding forest has begin to be harvested by the ogre and hobgoblins. An orc has been added too.

### Overrun Druid Grove
The young green dragon [[Breathtaker]] is impersonating the druid Trina Willowwealth. A thicket of magical thorny bushes wraps around the crumbling ruins of an elven mousoleum, clearly unkept. There is a feeling of unease surrounding the region.

The druidess will be welcoming to the travellers, attempting to lure them in to her clutches with teas poisoned with

# [[Castle Sungrand]]
---
Something else happens

The guards of Castle Sungrand are well trained soldiers, so they will fight in rank as best they can in order to control a battle field. They also have the *pack tactics* trait.

Armed soldiers guard checkpoints on the road and smaller watchtowers within 2 hexes of the castle. Typically a squad is a group of five guards and one or two veterans.

On the road, a **knight** will lead two veterans and seven guards, three of which have pikes instead of spears and shields.

### The Castle Grounds
The walls of the castle stand some 15 feet tall at most places, with an inner balcony and positions for archers. The castle itself is surrounded by a thick, marshy moat, bridged by a think wooden walkway that can easily be collapsed. The grounds are well kept and inside there are the signs of life that come with any equipped army: soldiers running drills, pigs and chickens minding their feed, horses being tended to.

The inner walls are taller, as the outer appears to have been erected to surround the homes in recent years. The inner keep is impressive and entirely stone, with a steel portcullis that can fall over large wooden doors. The small size of the fortress makes it clear to anyone that it is very defensible, especially given the mounted soldiers and those running formation.
