### Isilme's Dhampir Ritual
In order for Isilme to become dhampir and control the vampiric curse she will need to find someone who can protect her soul from being corrupted by the curse. [[Einzberns]] before have tried and failed. 
- Isilme will need vampire blood in order to be tainted by it. A mutagen will be formed using alchemy that might rend her susceptible to the transformation, but the process will be difficult.
- In order for the vampire blood to take hold of her, she will need to be branded. The exact shape of the form requires description.
**Prices**
- Creation of the mutagen requires an alchemy check.

>[!Transition]
>The liquid from within the cup drains through you. It is viscous. Bitter. After a moment a fire begins to burn through your veins. The muscles of your form bulge as veins of red etch through your form. You feel the changes reach through your body. The symbol on your back acting as a catalyst between your form and the substance that races through you. At the center of the rune on your back, the shape of a sword is formed and it begins to burn. You reach back, your hands forming claws that tear at the clothes on your back, leaving them tattered around you. Blood pours down your back as you almost unwillingly claw at the shape. The blood flows, but unlike before when you have been wounded in battle... it is cool. Cold. You arch your head back and unleash a violent scream as fangs become visible to those around. When you are finished, you collapse in a pulse of mist and light, as your hair shines a beautiful white silver.

**Isilme's Changes**
- Ask her to describe physical changes
- Her canines can grow into longer fangs that allow her to drain blood
- This terrible thirst accompanies her
- Once per day she may cast *Misty Step*
### Kanan's Athelstan Ritual
The Ritual of Unholy Severance was unsuccessful, but a part of Tevis and Kanan's connection to Athelstan was severed, and the portal was left unstable. In order to ensure that Athelstan is unable to escape, Kanan desires to find a permanent solution for him.

Tevis will advise Kanan on how to seal the blood fey away.

**Kanan will need**
- Mutagen refresh. To create a new mutagen that will bond to his form he will need Changeling or Doppelganger blood. Or someone will need to cast a powerful Resurrection spell on the Abomination in the [[Einzbern Hold]]'s transformation room.
- Someone who can cast *Planar Binding*. Such magic is required to will a part of Athelstan into submission. Subsequently, *Soul Cage* is necessary to transmute that part into a vessel that is appropriate.
- Once

>[!Transformation]
>A great flame begins to scorch the ground around you. Red. Hungry. It etches at your feet, up your legs. A great inferno arcs around the room. Encasing your entire form. You feel every singe every burn. You skin chars and melts away as the inferno reaches its height and black smoke pours from your body as your eyes boil in their sockets and your teeth crack, brittle from the heat. The fire dies down and you fall to what might be what is left of your knees a broken, black husk, the embers still burning. There is aloud cracking noise. A tear of some kind as fissures form along your body. What is left of the fire is roars with an intensity, as where the red flames burned before, a bright blue inferno roars to life, surrounding everything nearby with an intense, ever before felt heat. What remains of your form cracks and burns away. Your clothes are reduced to cinders as great wings of holy blue fire arch out triumphantly around you. The sigils on your hand glow, burning angrily with what remains  of the will of Athelstan, but the fire subsides, as your hair changes into a brilliant white.
