The great flaming force of the north, the Sleeping Odium, the Enemy Eternal, Bane of Steinwalde **Duvan'ahr** is an ancient red dragon who's only goal in life is the destruction of [[Steinwalde]], and to take the wealth that the dwarves have found within.

For nearly a millenia, the dragon has waged war on the mountain fortress in the [[Maghlas Mountains]], slumbering for some fifty years between her campaigns. She is one of two ancient red dragons in the west of the continent, the other being her mate: [[Imvaernarhro]].

Once, some few hundred years before the time of the [[Vanguard]], she left her lair region for a few weeks in order to mate with [[Imvaernarhro]]. This union brought about the birthing of many red dragon offspring, one of which being [[Chiaross]].
