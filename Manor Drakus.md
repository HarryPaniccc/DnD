# Study Space
The study space is a huge furnished room made of old stone flooring and well kept wooden accentuation. There is a fireplace along the rightmost wall filled with ash, adjacent to what appears to be a thick, dark iron brazier. Along the close right corner of the room there is just a turbulent mess of overturned and destroyed wooden furniture taken from various parts of the lavish manor, forming some form of birdâ€™s nest-like arrangement. The left side of the study consists of a well-kept bookshelf, which upon a quick glance is not very well stocked, to the point where it looks as though elements have been removed en mass. Behind an intricately carved desk and resting in the middle of the bookshelves hangs a beautiful green, velvet-like curtain that appears to conceal a doorway of some kind. The far wall is a beautiful segmented viewing window, stretching all 40ft of the width of the study.
# Curtained Room
This chamber appears to be an extension to the study space that you found yourself in, only the floor is pure stone. At the centre of the right wall there sits, atop what seems to be a mound of a couple dozen kilograms of just dirt, a wooden coffin with the lid open. Further display tables and shelves made of beautiful woodwork and metalwork have set atop them artefacts, all of which bare some semblance of the passage of time.
