# Description
**Arbiter Elend Mindfire** is the advisor to [[Persephone Adamos]] and the steward and lieutenant of [[Adamos Estate]]. He is practised in the arts of lawmaking, in controlling troops, and many other scholarly studies. He is of darker skin with a well-groomed beard and long hair often tied in a bun. He, too, is of [[Pyleas|Pylean]] descent. He wears the whites and blues of the [[Adamos Family]].

Growing up he was close to Lady Adamos and once he had secured a position as an arbiter of the [[Imperial Arcanists]] Persephone pulled enough strings to have him tied to the [[Adamos Family]] so that they might act together.
