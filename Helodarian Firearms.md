Firearms in this world work off a different ruleset compared to Exandria and the DMG. **Proficiency** with firearms works as a weapon type, as firearms are neither simple nor martial. A character without proficiency in firearms always rolls a 1 on the reload dice.
# Properties
## Missfire
A missfire score determines a firearms reliability on the battlefield. If the D20 roll on an attack made with a firearm rolls equal to or below the weapon's missfire score, the weapon jams. A DC 10 tinkers tools check as an action can unjam the firearm, but upon failing, the weapon will need to be repaired at a workbench over a short rest.
## Reload
The reload property of a firearm represents how many rounds a firearm can fire before needing to be reloaded. A weapon must be reloaded after firing a number of shots equal to its reload score.

The reload property of most firearms has a loading time of 30 seconds (5 actions). Some weapons have a duration in their reload property, defining the amount of actions required to load a single round into the weapon. Reloading requires the use of ignition paper, black powder (or an alternative powder), the bullet, and a plunger or plunging mechanism. Some weapons use pre-loaded packets of powder which drastically can reduce their reload score.

If the reload property of a firearm includes a die or dice, the firearm is designed in such a way that it can be reloaded as an action during combat, as opposed to spending a reload duration to reload one of the chambers. As an action, you may roll the reload dice and load a number of rounds into the weapon equal to the number rolled on the dice. Weapons that possess this property usually have some kind of quick-loading apparatus that is used to pack pre-packed rounds into the chambers, or uses some form of advanced chamber or rounds.
## Loading
Some firearms are designed with the intent to be quick to reload. The loading property works the same as with simple and martial weapons.
# Normal Firearms
Simple black powder weapons with slow reloads.

# Farrondale Firearms
The Farrondale family has been instrumental in developing proper casings for faster reloads. With only a single chamber and the difficulty being reloading after firing, the Farrondale family developed a kind of paper powder casing with a round in it that makes for very quick reloads, as it has been prepacked. Compared to a normal musket, which takes a long time to reload, Farrondale weapons are extremely valuable and highly regulated.
