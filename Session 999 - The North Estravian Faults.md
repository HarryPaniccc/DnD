**Previous Session:** [[Session 85 - Estravian Brigands]]
**Subsequent Session:** [[Session 999 - Witches and Dragonfire]]
## Introduction
This session note serves as a note for an online, text-based session that is proving to take some time. While Caede and Kanan traversed the [[Faults of North Estravia]], they face crossing dragon territory, as well as the people that live in the region

# Outline
---
### Promises
- [[Rudolph van Richten]] has a ghost following him
- White dragons hunt this region
- There is the corpse of a wizard somewhere here, and Kanan receives visions of his last days
### Bulleted Outline
- The characters need to cross the [[Faults of North Estravia]] and find [[Steinwalde]]
- They choose to go towards a road that is visible to the east, but going is slow and costs them time and food.
- The characters fall into the chasms below
- They may wander across the hag that lives within this region, or will have to escape a Tarrasque

### Travel Encounters
- Blizzard dice and some encounters from Icewind Dale - see the blizzard thing
- Roll to see if a random encounter occurs. Then roll and add 1 - if the number is greater than the encounter die, a blizzard begins 1d4 hours before and ends 1d4 hours after the encounter.

| Roll (1d6) + 1 per 2 days north of Valeria | Encounter - In Estravia                        |

# Kanan's Vision
---
> Every evening Kanan will receive a new vision from a lost spirit in this region form his **Grim Psychometry** feature

1. The howl of the wind has seemed eternal for days now. You're used to your hands being sore, the effects of age catching up to you, regardless of your power and knowledge, but now that feeling stretches into every bone and joint of your body. You can't be sure if the chill of the wind is to blame or just the exhaustion of trudging through the snow. Regardless, you push on. You have people to protect, and salvation cannot be much further north from where you are now. But the shadows at the edges of your vision... the numbness they offer cannot be far from warmth, can it? You rest your eyes for just a moment, and have to catch yourself from falling with your staff. No. They cannot have you yet.

2. The worst thing that could have happened was falling into these gods-damned chasms, but at least they offer protection from the wind chill and any hunting dragons overhead, although their fear of whatever is down here does not instill any security in your mind. Your hand grips your staff as it channels what warmth it can pull from the plane of fire. It might be the only reason you and those under your protection can still walk. Shadows shift around you, various corridoors of darkness that _feel_ full of hatred, wanting to claw at you and pull you into the abyss. You won't let them.

3. It has been days in this labyrinth, and now not many remain - most lost to ghouls or cold or shadows in the night. And the hordes follow still, as though they wait for the light of your power to falter, as you know it will. You are so tired. But you look down at the hand of the little girl clutching yours - old and whithered by comparison - and you know you can push on. Your only purpose now is to get as many of these poor souls home as you can, and pray that, for your mistakes and foolishness, you receive the punishment you deserve.
# Tarrasque
---
Deep within the caverns, of the faults hides a terrible, godlike secret: A Tarrasque wanders the mazes of the fissures, preying on anything foolish enough to enter its domain and acquire its notice. The creature wanders lathargically
