# Infernal Cuirass
*Heavy Armour (Plate), Very Rare, Requires Attunement*
You gain +2 to AC, +1 to Constitution saving throws, and can speak, read, and write Infernal. In addition you can use the armour to cast *hellish rebuke* at third level once per day.

> Cold to the touch red steel plates surround the wearer, while black chainmail protects the joints of the armour. The visages of tortured souls can be made out in the filigree of the metal, and hellish runes gently exude unholy light on the inside of the plates.
