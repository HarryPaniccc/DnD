# Crafting
Crafting and item by DMG rules and Xanathars takes incredibly long. The sell price of an item is roughly double that of the crafting cost. The crafting time in the DMG gives 25gp per day increment, which is ridiculously slow. *The idea is to quarter or eighth the crafting time.*

In order to craft an item, each 100gp of its **crafting cost** requires one day of work. Depending on the level, hiring a very skillful helper to aid in crafting at maybe 25gp per day can increase the productivity. Harder items, more expensive helpers.

>[!Example]
>For example, Silb's Dwarven Plate was commissioned at 40 000gp selling price. This puts its crafting price probably around the 20k - 25k gp, or, at best when working solo, 200 days of forging.
>
>Due to the number of skilled smiths aiding in the process, and the speciality of the forge, it makes sense to assign a large number of people working on the item, so if 5 dwarves worked on the armor, the work would take 40 days to complete $20000 \times  \frac{1}{100} \times \frac{1}{5} = 40$
### Components
Magical items can be crafted using the components found in the environment or harvested from dead monsters. The value of these items is deducted from the crafting cost

# Item Pricing

This section documents the value of items and how it is determined. Largely, the rarity determine's an item's value using the [[#DMG Pricing Table]]. In some cases, mostly potions, the price of an item falls widely outside of the rarity's expected value range.
### DMG Pricing Table
- Xanathar's has a magic item ingredients table: Item rarity connected to component CR https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#xge,2,awarding%20magic%20items
- There's also a brewing potion of healing section in Xanathar's

### Table of Item Values
Calculate based on rarity, amount of uses, half modifier for single-use items, and for utility and power. Different locations have different values.
>[!Important]
>Item VALUE displayed is how much the item is worth, usually selling price. This is a base vlaue, and for calculating costs can be halved
