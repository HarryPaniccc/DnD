# Ring of Mind Shielding
*Ring, Uncommon, Requires Attunement*
While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.

You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.

If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication.

# Aegis of the Onlooker
*Armor (Shield), Requires Attunement, Rare*
The Aegis is a great shield constructed of hammered steel and dark green iron. Adorned on the front of it are three gem-like eyeballs that cause unease and queasiness when stared at for too long. While wearing this shield, you have a +2 to Armor Class in addition to the normal bonus to AC granted by it. In addition, three times a day, immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 psychic damage to that creature.

# Skye's Locket of the Armory
*Wondrous Item, Rare, Requires Attunement*
This thick coin-like charm is set with 6 amber crystals on the outward face. Each amber crystal acts as a small pocket-dimension which is used to store magical items. As an action, one can store an item that can be held in two hands in one of the crystals, and with the same action retrieve an item from one of the pockets. The locket knows what item you are asking for.

Additionally, while attuned, you gain an additional attunement slot. Once per day, as an action, or part of the retrieval and stowing of an item in one of the crystals, one can change this attunement slot to the item being retrieved. This ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.

# Helm of Teleportation
*Wondrous Item (Helmet), Rare, Requires Attunement*

# Mace of the Righteous
*Weapon (Mace), Uncommon, Requires Attunement*
This magic mace warns you of danger. While the mace is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The **mace** magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.
