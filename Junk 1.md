# Potion of Hill Giant Strength
*Potion, Uncommon*
When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 21 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

> A sliver of a hill giant's fingernail is suspended in this potion, and the foul stench renders it unpleasant to swallow.

# Ring of Protection
*Ring, Rare, Requires Attunement*
You gain a +1 bonus to your AC and Saving Throws while wearing this ring.

> I never did trust elves. Something about knowing that they will outlast you makes me feel like they're just waiting until we die to reveal their true colours.
