Oriothar believes that his mother, [[Duvan'ahr the Sleeping Odium|Duvan'ahr]], has gone mad with her obsession in taking [[Steinwalde]] for herself, and exterminating the dwarves of the mountain. He understands the allure of the riches within the mountain fortress, but realizes that in order to take the city he will require an army of his own. He believes in uniting and coordinating the dragon forces which seperately all are making for the wealth within will be his best bet of conquering the city.

Oriothar is ruthless, valuring no life over his strategic benefits. He has been known to sacrifice the life of one offspring in order to show the others of the clutch that alone they will be overpowered by the dwarves. He has stolen eggs from white dragon nests and raised the young as his own animalistic soldiers.
