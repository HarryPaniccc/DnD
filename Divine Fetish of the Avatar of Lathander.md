AND

Once in a 24 hour period you may attempt to cause a new dawn to occur which will cause the sun to rise around you in a 1 mile radius, recharge "recharges at dawn" features, and allow allies in a 30 foot radius to gain the benefits of a short rest.

# Planning
I like the idea that the item is able to fast forward time to the next dawn in a localised region. Like "as an action, the region within one mile of you is magically tansferred to a new dawn for the next hour and recharges shit" and also like "short rest benefit in a 100ft. radius" or something similar.
